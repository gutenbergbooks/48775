LITERARY EVENING FIRE-SIDE.</h1>

<h2>A FRIEND OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE
TO ITS READERS.</h2>


<p>There is nothing in which the honourable
fame and steady prosperity
of our country, and the best interests
of its inhabitants, are more deeply involved,
than in <em>the promotion of</em>
<em>agriculture</em>. With one hundred and
twenty millions of acres of <em>cleared</em>,
or <em>natural, strong, unwooded</em> land,
and a population computed at nine
millions of persons, we have more
soil already prepared for plantations,
farms and grazing, in proportion to
our numbers, than any other civilized
people; and our capacities to add to
our quantity of cleared or unwooded
land, extend to ten times the number
of acres. From the productions of
these lands have our former happiness
and wealth arisen, and from the
commerce and fabrication of these
productions, have our foreign and domestic
trade, and all our home manufactures,
worth above two hundred
millions of dollars, sprung up. The
merchants and manufacturers actually
hold so real and great a competition
for the natural and agricultural productions
of the land, that none of
these productions, capable of manufacture,
were exported even in the
last year, except <em>cotton</em>, in the manufacture
of which we had made very
great progress, in 1810; even without
the double and war duties, or
those existing at this time. They
were supposed to be worth 15,000,000
of dollars in that year. The present
crisis, when all nations are revising
and improving their systems of agriculture,
commerce and manufactures,
appears to be a fit season for increased
attention, consideration and exertion
on our part; and first in the culture
of the soil. It is proposed, as a
suitable object for such a work as
<cite>The Rural Magazine</cite>, to make some
of those exertions in relation to <em>agriculture</em>
<em>and the connected subjects</em>,
which are often demanded by those
strong tides in human life, which are
dispensed to us in the course of divine
Providence. Pennsylvania, and the
five other states which are contiguous
to her, making six in their whole
number, contain about one hundred
and forty millions of acres of land in
the most temperate and genial <em>farming</em>
climates of our country. The
southern parts of that noble farming
district even favours the cotton, the
vine and the fig tree; and every species
of production, requiring the tone
of the northern part of the temperate
zone for its growth or the fabrication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of those productions, is adapted to the
higher latitudes of that region of our
country. The best culture of the
eastern states is comprehended in the
proper farming of that district. The
effectual bearing of the productions
of the south upon the profits of the
farming of the middle, northern and
eastern states, will always render the
actual or new culture of our great
southern district of sugar, rice, indigo,
cotton and grape vines, deeply
important us; because the cultivation
of those and other productions,
adapted to their climates, will prevent
their attention, as principal objects,
to those things which must always be
produced by our cattle, grass, apple,
vegetable and grain farms. The cider
and apple brandy, for example,
of the county of <em>Morris</em>, in New Jersey,
which far exceeds the general
belief, the superfine flour of the white
wheat country of this middle district,
and the fabrications of the dairy of
the eastern states, sustain no interference
at home or abroad, from the
productions of those southern labourers
who are employed on sugar, rice,
cotton, indigo and tobacco; or may
be employed on the fruit of the grape
vine, the olive tree and their fabrications,
which annually yield to France
one hundred and twenty millions of
dollars. The culture of the southern
states is, therefore, in truth, a fit subject
of attention and solicitude for the
Pennsylvanians, and their surrounding
northern and eastern brethren; and
valuable papers on that subject would
always deserve a place in <cite>The Rural
Magazine</cite>. If the African <span class="smcap">Terence</span>
has been quoted, beyond any other
writer, for the beautiful exclamation
of one of his personified characters,
"<em>Homo</em> sum, et nihil humani a me
alienum puto,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> how impossible is it
for a true and faithful member of this
favoured nation to forget to exclaim,
"<em>Americanus</em> sum, et nihil <em>Americani</em>
a me alienum puto."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Some of the most important practices
of agriculture belong to all our
climates. <em>Irrigation</em>, beautiful, elegant,
profitable <em>irrigation</em>, or the watering
of grounds, by turning upon
them streams that have been wont to
run waste, and pour their unused vegetative
powers into navigable rivers,
is a great example. The venerable
and judicious <span class="smcap">Arthur Young</span> wrote
to his compatriots in England, from
the districts of Piedmont and Milan,
the best irrigated parts of <em>the valley
of the Po</em>, that such was the perfection
of that branch of agriculture
and the connected branches of working
and neat cattle, dairies, rice, &amp;c.
that, excellent as was their English
system in his vicinity, his friends could
have no conception of perfection in
farming, without visiting that part of
upper Italy. The orange trees are
carefully irrigated in the kingdom of
Portugal, as are the vines of Madeira,
and the rice in those of our southern
states which produce that wholesome,
valuable and delightful grain.</p>

<p>Let us, then, in every section of our
country, keep attention on the stretch
<em>to improve our whole landed interest</em>,
which, like our great internal seas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
our heaven dispensed lakes, is the
natural head, from which the sister
streams of <em>commerce and manufactures</em>
are, unforcedly, to flow, and run
till the end of time.</p>

<h2>THE DESULTORY REMARKER.</h2>

<h3>No. VII.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Travel in the younger sort is a part of education; in
the elder a part of experience.</p>

<p class="sig1">
<i>Bacon.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>In pursuance of the plan proposed
in the initial number of these papers,
which, although a mortifying consideration
to the pride of authorship, it
is quite probable many of my readers
have already forgotten; I shall, on
the present occasion, avail myself of
one of the sources of instruction and
gratification there indicated&mdash;foreign
travel. The friend to whom I am indebted
for the following remarkable
incidents, illustrative of the present
state of morals in Italy, has not long
since returned from a tour through
England, France, Italy, Switzerland,
and part of Germany; with an increased
attachment for his native
country and her admirable institutions.</p>

<p>He left Milan for Florence, passing
through the towns of Lodi, Plazenza,
Parma, and Bologna, where
he arrived after eight days journeying.
Among the passengers in the
coach with him, was a young gentleman
of Rome, the Cavaliere V&mdash;&mdash;, who
was returning home after a two years
tour in <em>South</em> America and Europe.
Between these two, as those who are
strangers in any part of the world,
particularly when travelling together,
experience a community of privation
and enjoyment, an intimacy was soon
formed. The distance from Florence
to Rome is 193 English miles. The
road passes over the Appenine mountains,
and by the tardy mode of travelling
peculiar to the country, there
being no public coaches, it requires
six days. The highways in this neighbourhood
are infested with banditti of
the most ferocious character, and almost
every day furnishes accounts of
robberies and murders. On the 5th
of January, 1819, they left Florence.
The first three days were marked by
no striking incident, but on the morning
of the fourth, about dawn, their
ears were accosted with a sudden discharge
of fire-arms close to the carriage,
which they soon found to proceed
from the carbines of banditti.
Previously to quitting Milan, our
friend had taken the precaution to
divide his gold, carrying part of it
about his person, enveloped in a bandana
handkerchief in the form of a
belt, and the remainder in a portmanteau.
He had also a number of Bank
of England notes, which he carried
in his pocket-book, with his passport,
&amp;c. The bandana soon attracted their
attention, and its contents, 30 Napoleons,
with his purse, &amp;c. fell into
their hands. His portmanteau being
securely lashed to the imperial, escaped
the plunderers, as well as his
watch and pocket-book. It was within
a league of Montifiascone where
the attack was made. The robbers
were interrupted in the height of
their villainy, by the tramp of approaching
horses, which proved to
be the neighbouring peasantry commencing
their daily toils; and retreated
with precipitation to the impenetrable
thickets of the Appenines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
The travellers then proceeded on
their journey to Rome, without experiencing
further molestation.</p>

<p>On their arrival there, our countryman
congratulated himself on his good
fortune in having become acquainted
with the Cavaliere V&mdash;&mdash;, whose
politeness and attentions were particularly
grateful; and as Rome was
the place of his residence, every object
of interest and curiosity to be
found there, was perfectly familiar to
him. He introduced his American
acquaintance to his father, who was a
man of rank, living in splendour and
opulence; and to his sisters, whose
society the latter felt every disposition
to cultivate. Thus various circumstances
appeared to combine to render
pleasant a residence in this celebrated
metropolis, and to aid him in
his contemplations among the remaining
monuments of her former magnificence
and power.</p>

<p>One morning having a leisure hour
on his hands, our townsmen was engaged
in his chamber counting his
money, in order to ascertain the extent
of his loss, sustained by the unwelcome
visiters who had paid him
their respects on the road; when the
Cavaliere unceremoniously entered
the room, and seeing a pocket-book in
his hand, immediately inquired what
he had lost. The fact was, that a 20
pound note of the Bank of England
was missing, and as the pocket-book
in which the notes were contained,
was not discovered by the banditti, in
their haste to make their escape, he
concluded that it had been carelessly
dropped at some time or other, and
would never again be heard of; which
he stated at once to his pseudo friend.
The latter expressed some surprise,
and evinced considerable embarrassment
on the occasion. His quondam
fellow tourist, however, made light of
the matter, and endeavoured to change
the conversation by stating, that he
would ask the advice of his banker
the duke of Torlonia, fortunately the
only house in the habit of discounting
English notes; and would also
write to his banker in London, to have
the payment stopped at the Bank of
England. To this plan the Cavaliere
strenuously objected, but said, that
he knew a man in Rome, who would
procure him the note if it was to be
found; and in consequence of this
suggestion, the application to the
Duke was not made. Our traveller,
reflecting on the circumstances
connected with this interview, his being
interrogated as to his loss before
any intimation had been given that
such loss had been sustained, the hurried
and peculiar manner in which
the inquiries were made, in addition
to the fact that the Cavaliere was the
only person who had seen them
counted, and that he was careless
of locking up his pocket-book,
began to suspect, although his
rank and standing might forbid it,
that the gentleman knew something
about the note. As the numbers of
the different bills had been taken,
there could not readily have been a
mistake. A few days subsequently
it was distinctly intimated, that the
person to whom application had been
made, knew where the note was. An
interview with the <em>conjurer</em> was zealously
urged, in the hope of visiting
the thief with merited punishment.
To this the Cavaliere replied, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
had pledged his honour that the affair
should remain in profound secrecy,
and that he would himself be responsible
for the payment, and accordingly
gave his note of hand for it payable
in two days! After <em>many</em> days had
elapsed without receiving the amount,
the patience of our traveller was nearly
exhausted, and under the influence
of irritation, produced by the unprincipled
conduct of this modern Roman,
it was determined to disclose
the whole transaction to his father.
The subject was introduced with the
utmost delicacy. The old gentleman,
after hearing a detail of all the
circumstances, coolly observed, that
it was no business of his, and that his
son would doubtless attend to it. He
was then explicitly told, that respect
for his supposed parental feelings had
induced the reserve which he had witnessed;
but as this reserve, it was
perfectly apparent, was altogether unnecessary,
the facts of the case should
be made known, and the moral turpitude
of his son publicly exposed.&mdash;The
expression of this determination
caused an immediate change of tone
and manner; he was now all sensibility
to the reputation of his son and
that of his family, and gave a positive
assurance that the money should be
immediately forthcoming. Shortly
after this conversation it was brought
by his quondam friend, and was principally
in various gold coins, which
had probably been procured for him
by a broker, on the lowest terms.</p>

<p>The family, in which our countryman
resided, while at Rome, was
highly agreeable; and the society of
the lady, and her amiable daughters,
was a source of pleasure to the gentlemen
who lived in the house. On the
evening of the day on which this affair
was settled, he had taken his
wonted seat in this interesting circle,
which so delightfully reminded him of
that which he had left at home, when
the brother of the Cavaliere, who
was invested with some office of dignity,
entered in full dress. He very
courteously and gracefully paid his
respects to all the individuals composing
the company, with the exception
of the American, of whom, notwithstanding
his being well acquainted
with him, he took no notice whatever.
He then intimated to the lady of the
house, that he wished to speak with
her in private. She accordingly withdrew,
and very soon afterwards returned,
and informed our tourist, that
the gentleman desired to see him in
the adjoining room. On entering,
he was charged with attempting to
sully the character of a family, which
could trace its reputation and fame
through a long line of noble ancestry;
and that for this injustice, instant reparation
should be made. He then
drew his sword in a tempest of passion,
but recollecting immediately,
that his antagonist was unarmed, he
sheathed it, and drew from his pocket
a pair of pistols, with which he insisted
they should fight without delay.
By this time one of the party,
alarmed by the noise occasioned by
their altercation, hurried into the
room, and on learning the cause
which produced it, gave such explanations
to the enraged Italian as were
acknowledged to be perfectly satisfactory,
as to the treatment his brother
had received; and with a smile,
which he could assume at pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he took his leave. After his departure,
the lady took occasion to caution
our traveller against venturing out
during the evening, assigning as a
reason for this advice, that the officer
was very vindictive in his disposition,
and that an Englishman, who had not
long previously given him some offence,
lost his life in consequence of
the attack of an assassin. This admonition
was not disregarded. In the
course of the evening, a member of
the family, who had heard nothing of
the previous occurrences, on his return
home, observed, that he could
not conceive what mischief was in
agitation, as his face had been closely
examined by more than one person,
in passing the lamps, who wore masks,
and appeared to be actuated by curiosity,
or some other motive, to an extraordinary
degree. Those who were
acquainted with the events of the evening,
were at no loss to conjecture for
whom they were on the watch. An
obnoxious individual can at any time
be put out of the way, in Rome, for
a very small reward. To save these
obliging and tender-hearted gentry
further trouble, and to consult his
own safety, he early the next morning
left the dominions of the church,
and pursued his journey to Naples.</p>

<p>If individuals, and incidents of such
a character, should frequently present
themselves to the notice of the tourist,
it would almost induce him to deny
himself the delights and advantages
of foreign travel, and adopt this
sentiment of <span class="smcap">Cowley</span>,</p>

<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>Twice in every year our otherwise
quiet village is thrown into a ferment,
which agitates its little community
like an earthquake, and unsettles all
the habits of order and industry for
which we are usually remarkable.
The cause of this great tumult is the
militia training&mdash;that system which
supposes every citizen to be a soldier,
and undertakes to instruct him in the
art and mystery of holding a musket
and putting the right foot foremost.
On the last of these occasions, I was
surprised to find that my whole school
had played truant; and observing an
unusual ferment in the streets, found,
upon inquiry, that at the last election
for officer, Ezekiel Snip, the village
tailor, a man with fierce red whiskers
and a peculiar altitude of chin, had
been elected captain. Ezekiel had dipt
into Duane's Hand-Book, and was esteemed
profoundly skilled in the manual
exercise; so that the neighbours
were all on the tiptoe of expectation to
witness the parade of the day. As this
took place opposite to my school-room,
I seated myself quietly at the
window to watch how matters proceeded.
About eight o'clock, the tavern
porch began to be filled with
people, some bringing old rusty rifles,
others their fowling pieces, and some
armed with a stout oaken stick. Then
sallied forth a valiant drummer, aided
by a no less valiant fifer, at the head
of some dozens of the town boys, to
alarm the village. They marched up
the street, and down the street, and
beat tantarara, and whistled out of all
tune,&mdash;till my head ached,&mdash;to the
infinite delight of the idle urchins at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
their heels, and the gaping housemaids
at the doors and windows, as
they passed. When this preparatory
ceremony was gone through, forth
issued captain Snip from the tavern
door, in all the glory of a blue coat,
epaulettes, a sword and feather. The
militia-men were then ranged out in
ranks, and the muster-roll called. I
was particularly struck with the assemblage
present. I looked in vain
for the most respectable of our mechanics
and neighbouring farmers.&mdash;The
ranks were chiefly filled with the
idle young men of the village and the
tavern frequenters of the neighbourhood;
in short, with men who hung
loose upon society, and were eager
for every adventure that would enable
them to get through a day, without
work, and might end in a drinking
match. Captain Snip bustled
about with becoming self-importance,&mdash;fixed
this man six inches back, and
that one as much forward, and having
thus ranged them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la militaire</i>, proceeded,
by the aid of his Hand-Book,
to induct them into the manual exercise.
At the word "Shoulder fire-locks,"
a scene of confusion ensued.
Some had their pieces on the right
and some on the left shoulder, and
they were ranged at all angles from a
perpendicular to a horizontal line.&mdash;With
infinite difficulty, and after repeated
trials, the captain got them to
order and proceeded to the next command.
As he went on I observed
that he became impatient and confused;
the disorder into which his company
were continually getting, surpassed
his abilities to rectify, and his
limited and superficial knowledge began
to fail him. He quite lost his
authority over his men; but by dint
of storming, succeeded at last in getting
some how through the business.
The drum then sounded, and the gallant
troop marched out to the commons,
there to encamp for the day,
carrying in their train all the noisy
and idle boys of the town.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they again made
their appearance, dusty, fatigued, and
disorderly, and after a sham exercise
in the street, were dismissed. It was
a glorious day for the sellers of cakes,
and beer, and brandy, and whiskey.
Many a bottle that day was emptied
of its fiery contents, and many a miserable
wretch strengthened in the habits
of vice and dissipation. Scarce
a man of this valiant corps returned
home sober. The tavern door was a
scene of continued quarrelling and
the most shocking profanity, till eleven
o'clock.</p>

<p>Battle succeeded battle, to the infinite
diversion of the by-standers, and
to the edification and instruction of the
lads of all sizes that were thronging
to this school of morality. I know
not how captain Snip felt upon descending
to his ordinary employment,
from such a height of military glory,
but I myself have been sad and melancholy
ever since, when I reflected
upon the events of the day.</p>

<p>And what, fellow citizens, is the
great good attained by these militia
trainings? It is the idlest of idle
dreams to suppose the recurrence,
four times in the year, of such scenes
as I have described, can make soldiers
of our yeomanry. It may make
idlers, it may make bullies, and
drunkards, and gamblers of them;
but what they learn of military discipline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the subordination of a camp,
is not worth a farthing candle. You
lose to the state the labour of a hundred
thousand men, that they may be
placed under the tuition of some half-learned
captain, who, perhaps, has never
been in a camp, and who does not,
in the course of years, teach them
more than they could at any time learn
as well and better in half a day's real
service. The good done to the state
by these militia laws is a mere shadow,
and the wounds which they inflict
upon the steady habits, the industry
and the morality of the country,
are awful and portentous. I believe
I do not exceed probability in asserting,
that one half of the drunkenness in
the state, is induced or confirmed at
these militia trainings.</p>

<p>But it is not only in the effects
upon those who obey the mandate
of the law, that this system is to be
deprecated. Look at it, in what light
you will, it is injurious and oppressive.
A large portion of your fellow citizens
are men who will not, in any
cause, take the life or connive at the
death of a fellow creature. They
believe that the great Author of being
retains in his own hand the power
over life, and that it is impious in
mortals to assume his prerogative.&mdash;No
matter how true or false this may
be, it is with them an article of religious
faith, and as such is held sacred
by our constitution. Whatever law
interferes with this article of their belief
is, to them, persecution. If man
has no moral right to take the life of
his fellow, government can have no
moral right to oblige him to do it;
and they who obey the law, in preference
to their conscience, are traitors
to their God. If they obey your military
requisition, they become a party
to a system altogether at variance
with their faith. They cannot pay
the fines which you impose for their
refusal, for you demand them as an
equivalent for what they cannot concede
to you. Here then are they placed,
without (according to their belief)
the power of moving. If you
insist upon the payment, you must
despoil them of their goods. It is to
be sure alleged, that the state cannot,
with a due regard to its own
safety, dispense with the military allegiance
of its citizens. Admit this
to be the case. Do you, in abstaining
from the petty, alienating vexations
of a militia law in time of peace,
yield or forego the claim to this allegiance?
You pass an edict oppressive
to a class of citizens, whose motive
for non-compliance is sacred in
the eye of the constitution,&mdash;an edict,
which your experience of the past assures
you, they will not comply with,
and you create, in order to enforce it,
a race of harpies, who are trained
under it in all the arts of oppression
and plunder. And to what good end?
Does one solitary dollar of these
militia exactions pass into your treasury?
Is it not, on the contrary, a
well known fact, that after seizing
upon twice or thrice the just amount
of the claim, the proceeds of the sale
of these goods melt away before they
reach the public treasury? The ostensible
object of the law is to train
the yeomenry in the art of war. My
word for it, its actual operation is
more to enervate than to strengthen,
and while it forms a dark blot on the
escutcheon of our state, there is not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in its consequences, a single salutary
effect to compensate for the hardships
it inflicts upon the followers of the
great statesman, who laid the foundations
of our public and private prosperity,
our liberal institutions; of all,
in short, which has rendered Pennsylvania
the boast and the envy of
nations.</p>

<h2>ROUTE TO NIAGARA PALLS.</h2>


<p><i>To the Editors.</i>&mdash;During the continuance
of the fervid season, some of
your readers will probably beguile
the tedium of mid-summer, by taking
excursions in various directions, as
health or curiosity may happen to
invite them. The gratification to be
derived from pursuing the route to
<span class="smcap">Niagara Falls</span>, and thence to Montreal
and Quebec, will amply repay
all its fatigues, and realise the expectations
of the tourist however highly
excited. The following indicates one
of the most agreeable avenues of
approach to that unparalleled wonder
of Nature. Having felt the want
of some such information myself, it
was thought it might be acceptable
to others, who have no better guide.
These distances, though derived principally
from innkeepers, stage-drivers,
&amp;c. are sufficiently accurate for
the purposes of travellers generally.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center"><i>A remarkable instance of premonition
of impending death.</i></p>

<p>Your readers may rely on the authenticity
of what follows, as I assure them I copied
it myself from the original letter in
the well known hand writing of John Ross,
Esq. deceased, who was an eminent attorney
at law in this city, for many years before
the American revolution, and also a
member of the legislature, as a number
still living can remember. The letter was
addressed to his friend Dr. Cadwalader
Evans, of this city, but then settled for a
few years in the Island of Jamaica. The
accident happened to John Kinsey, Jun.
He was the son of John Kinsey, Esq., one
of the most eminent lawyers of his time,
also speaker of the Assembly and chief
justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</p>

</p></blockquote>


<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Evans,</span></p>

<p>I am going for Newcastle, early
in the morning. I just heard of a
vessel going to Jamaica before my
return; so in haste determine to give
you one scrawl, lest you should think
the neighbourhood forget you. But
you may depend that will never happen:
we gratefully and cordially remember
you often. I would tell you
all the news in a word, if possible,
with all haste. To begin&mdash;our neighbourhood
just as you left us, only B.
Franklin lives in your house. The
Col. Hellier not yet gone to sea. I
think all your acquaintance continue
well, save poor Johnny Kinsey, jun.
on Tuesday, the 8th inst. by accident
shot himself dead, coming over Gray's
ferry, by Schuylkill falls, while in the
boat. He had loaded his gun, and,
as is supposed, let the butt drop on
the bottom of the flat, the gun in a
line with his body by his side; went
off when half cocked. The whole
load of shot struck his left cheek,
and went up directly into his brain.
He dropped and was dead in an instant&mdash;never
groaned. Great sorrow
attended his father, and all his friends,
for the accident. He had strange apparitions
of his death the night before,
which he informed his aunt
Bowene of at breakfast, the morning
of the accident. I must relate to you
the particulars which are as true as
surprising. He, talking with his
aunt at breakfast concerning his being
admitted as an attorney and going
into business, said, he believed he had
nothing to do with business, for his
time, he thought, was not long in this
world. He said that last night he
was strangely disturbed in his sleep
with dreams and apparitions; that
his cousin Charles Pemberton, who
died last spring, appeared to him,
wrapped in a sheet, and said to him,
"Kinsey, your time approaches, you
must go with me," and he disappeared.
Soon after, appeared a person
before him in the form of an angel,
(according to the idea he had of an
angel) and said to him "Kinsey, your
hour is come, you must go with me,"
and instantly he thought a flash of
lightning struck him on the cheek
and he instantly died. This was followed
by a severe clap of thunder
and lightning that awaked him from
his sleep, and all those particulars
came fresh to his memory, and gave
him a great uneasiness. (Note&mdash;no
thunder or lightning that night.)&mdash;Upon
this he endeavoured to get
asleep again, and after dozing a short
time, he was awaked by the noise of
a person walking across the room,
giving a heavy groan. He heard or
saw no more, but got out of bed and
went into the other room, called the
Scotch boy to bring in his bed and
lay by him the remainder of the
night. In the morning, at breakfast,
on Tuesday last, he communicated
all the before related to his aunt
Bowene and Hannah Kearney. He
seemed much dejected upon it, was
confident he was near his end; but
to divert himself for that day, he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to take his gun and go fowling
with young J. Derborow, young
Oxley, and two or three more. They
walked to Coultas' ferry and crossed
Schuylkill, and up to the falls ferry.
He told the company several times,
as they walked, he wished no accident
might befall him before he got
home. On their return, crossing the
ferry in the boat, the unhappy accident
happened him. Thus you have
the particulars of this melancholy affair,
as fully as I could relate it if with
you, and I chose to be particular in
it, because I have met with no story
in history so well attested as this concerning
the premonitions from heaven
of our dissolution. The flash that
struck his cheek when asleep, was
clearly answered by the flash of the
gun and the shot thereof first striking.
His aunt laboured to persuade
him not to go a gunning that day,
and he agreed; but afterwards meeting
his company, they prevailed with
him, as they had all agreed to go the
night before.</p>

<p>Your father and all friends are well.
I sincerely wish you all imaginable
felicity, and with all the haste I began,
I cannot help now concluding
that I am your very affectionate friend
and humble servant,</p>

<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>

<h2>FIRMITY AND HOMINY.</h2>


<p>There are two ancient very wholesome
and pleasant dishes, which are
much used in the states south of
Pennsylvania, to which the middle and
northern states have not yet paid sufficient
attention. The first called
<span class="smcap">FIRMITY</span>, is made of <span class="smcap">WHEAT</span>. The
second, called <span class="smcap">HOMINY</span>, is made of
<span class="smcap">Indian corn</span>, or <span class="smcap">MAIZE</span>. The grains
of wheat and Indian corn are prepared
by beating in the same manner in
a wooden mortar, with an iron pestle,
filed in crosses or ridges at the bottom,
like a modern stamp or seal for
letters.</p>

<p>To make the firmity mortar, or
hominy mortar, select a tree of from
two feet to two feet and one half in
diameter. Cut off a length (or piece
as nearly as possible cylindrical) of
about the height of a man's waistband
from the ground. Let an iron
hoop be well secured on and around
each of the ends, to bind and keep
the wood together. Then make a
hole at each end of this cut of wood,
like the cavity of a common mortar,
as wide as the wood will admit, at
top, and narrowing to a blunt point at
the bottom. Both cavities are to
be made alike, so that in fact, in the
one cylindrical piece of wood, there
will be two mortars; one in and at
each end. These may be used indiscriminately
for wheat or firmity, or
for Indian corn or hominy, and will
occasion the utensil to last longer.&mdash;It
will be proper not to have the bottoms
of the two mortars, or mortar
holes, so deep as to endanger the driving
a hole from one into the other,
which would destroy the use of both.
When the mortar is thus well made,
a moderate quantity of wheat, to make
firmity, is to be put into the mortar,
in the upper part, as it stands on the
end, and the grain is to be moistened
with a little warm water, to make the
skin or bran come off easily and perfectly,
by the beating. The pestle
is then to be used by a man so as, by
striking in among the grains of wheat,
from the top to the bottom of the parcel,
from time to time, and repeatedly,
to skin the grains of wheat, which
it will do effectually. When this is
done, the grains are to be separated
from the hulls or bran, by a sieve
large enough to let the wheat through
and keep out the bran or skin. When
this has been done, the parcel is spread
to dry, on a clean coarse linen or cotton
cloth. The proper quantity is
put into a large family pot, with a
sufficient quantity of water to boil it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and to be evaporated by a steady simmering
heat from 8 or 9 in the evening
till 9 or 10 next morning. Thus
the firmity will be made into a large
mass of white mixture of paste or
pulp of wheat, and of whole wheat.
This is to be taken out in portions, as
wanted to make a mess, boiled with
skim or common milk, as thick as
pea-soup or rice-milk, and sweetened
to the taste. A small lump of butter,
of the size of a nutmeg, is often
put into the tureen or soup-dish of
firmity, at the moment when it is
served up hot. Some use a little nutmeg
and a very little salt. Firmity is
used after the meat meal, which need
be but small when there is firmity for
dinner, for it is a very hearty and pleasant
food. At supper there is no occasion
for meat.</p>

<p>Hominy is prepared in like manner,
except that it is served up without
milk, and that it is diluted moderately
with hot water. A little butter
and salt may be added; and on following
days hominy is often fried in a
large cake to the size of the pan.&mdash;Hominy,
in every form and state, is
very good with the gravy of roasted
beef, mutton, lamb, and poultry,
steaks, chops, and cutlets.</p>

<p>It is believed, that wheat and Indian
corn are much more wholesome
in firmity and hominy, than in bread
or <em>pone</em>. No yeast is required.&mdash;Great
quantities of grain might be
used in this way. Every thing that
employs our grain, which is becoming
redundant, is an object worthy of consideration
and attention. A great number
of the best living and most expensive
families in Philadelphia, from
Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia,
use hominy and firmity with the greatest
relish; and if suitable mortars
were sent thither for sale, the use of
this food would increase.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>


<p>Weeds, and larger growths, which
interfere with cultivation or impoverish
the ground, should be cut down
or pulled up, <em>before the seed ripens</em>,
in August, which prevents their growing
in a following year. Weeds are
the successful rivals of grain, garden
vegetables, and grass.</p>

<p>Now is the <span class="smcap">BUILDING</span> season. All
our country houses and places for
work, should be built on the south
and west sides of swamps, marshes,
ponds, and other fresh waters, <em>on account
of health</em>; and not on the north or
east sides of any such wet or watery places.
The summer winds blow from
the south and west, and carry the unwholesome
vapours, exhaled from
those fresh waters, from places on
their south and west sides, to places
on the north and east sides, preserving
the people's health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White covers</span> of linen, cotton, or
even paper, to the hats of people
working in the fields, fishing, fowling,
travelling, &amp;c. protect them from
morbid or sickening strokes of the
sun. This is an old practice among
the judicious Swiss.</p>

<p>Now, when all the waters are becoming
low, we should observe the
places for tapping swamps, marshes,
and ponds. By cutting a drain to
draw off the water in its low state, in
August, we begin to reclaim our
lands from the marsh and swamp.&mdash;The
ground becomes firmer to haul
off the wood and timber in the cutting
season. Wet grounds should be
drained, before they are cleared of
their wood. For, if they are freed
from trees, <em>in their wet state</em>, the sun
produces sickening and often fatal
evaporations. This is true in France,
Germany, Holland, and the marshy
parts of England, though several degrees
further north than the United
States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dry Rot.</i>&mdash;This destructive enemy
of building, which generally commences
its ravages in the cellars, may
be prevented or checked, by whitewashing
them yearly, mixing copperas
with it to give it a yellow hue.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Sesamum Orientale</span> or
<span class="smcap">Be-ne</span>, written <span class="smcap">Bene</span>, for making oil
of the seed, from Bengal, Africa,
Georgia, and the Mississippi. See
Archives of Useful Knowledge, by
Dr. Mease; Encyclopædia Britanica;
Accounts of East India Agriculture,
&amp;c. It is planted in the end of
April and gathered in the end of September,
in 32° N. lat.; raised also
in 34° 50' N. lat. The oil is fine for
salad, and all the other uses of <em>olive</em>
oil, and may be extracted, as is the
flax-seed oil, or by boiling water, to
the top of which it will rise, and may
be skimmed, and bottled or put into
casks. It is very common on the
west coast of Africa, and grows to
most advantage on poor, sandy hills.
It is said never to become rancid, but
to improve with age. [Letter of
Thomas M. Forman, Esq. Rose Hill,
near Savington, Cecil, Md.] In the
same letter is an account of Napoleon
or Crawford <span class="smcap">RYE</span>. It is described
to grow very tall, having a solid stalk,
probably capable of resisting the fly,
like Jethro Tull's solid-stalked wheat.
This grain is said to improve in the
Cecil county soil and climate.</p>

<p>2. Plan of <span class="smcap">FENCES</span> of living trees
for posts, such as the Sugar Maple,
and <em>wire</em> for rails; by White &amp; Hazard,
Whitestown, Philadelphia county,
lowest falls of Schuylkill. Common
fence for 100 acres, for 50 years,
costs $3,080. Do. of wire fence for
50 years, costs $1,751. Add profit
on trees, such as American black
Walnut, curled or sugar Maple, Mulberry,
Apple, (244 trees producing
annually, at one dollar, $244) Buttonwoods,
&amp;c. which the projectors
make to produce $14,098, in fifty
years. Interest on annual produce
sufficient to keep such wire and live-tree
fence in repair, from the time of
completion for ever. Other orchard
lands can be spared. These fences
are good against the worst cows;&mdash;they
are easy to repair. Inquire at
R. Watkin's tavern, at the falls of
Schuylkill.</p>

<p>3. Accounts of <span class="smcap">LIME</span> and <span class="smcap">KILNS</span>,
and cooking <span class="smcap">STOVES</span>, in Spain; by
Anthony Morris, Esq. formerly of
Philadelphia, now of Bucks county,
Pennsylvania, A. D. 1816.&mdash;In burning
lime, the Spanish peasants use
only the small Shrub or brush wood,
not larger than a man's little finger
to the size of a pipe stem. The kiln
is like ours in Whitemarsh, &amp;c. except
that the top of the kiln is very
little above the surface of the ground,
and is covered with clay to confine
the heat. The arch within is of such
height as to give the full benefit of
all the flame of those dry, light materials.
The Spanish lime, like our best
Pennsylvania lime, is very good. The
Spanish practice is recommended,
where lime stone is plenty, wood
scarce, and brush, trash and weeds
so abundant as to impede or injure
culture. In the same letter is a cheap
method, as to fuel, for heating irons;
and an economical kitchen, as to fire,
for cooking.</p>

<p>4. A letter from Mr. Jefferson,
concerning the success of the <span class="smcap">Gypsum</span>,
or Plaster of Paris, in Albemarle,
Virginia, 200 miles from the
sea-coast; also concerning improved
hill ploughing, by his ingenious son-in-law,
Col. Thomas M. Randolph.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>5. An American Plough, approved in
England; as is our Cradling Scythe.</p>

<p>6. Also, further notice of the Mangel
Wurtzel, for the culture of which see
the Philadelphia Society's Memoirs,
vol. III. Seed of a new kind, called
the orange-coloured Mangel Wurtzel,
has been sent to President Peters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
by Robert Barclay, Esq. grandson to
the old Apologist of Uri. The progress
in the culture of this root, in
Great Britain, is great. Mr. Peters
thinks the mottled kind best, and recommends
the greatest care as to
seed. It appears in other parts of
this volume that 60 to 90 tons of Mangel
Wurtzel, or Scarcity Root, or
the improved Beet, have been produced
by an acre.</p>

<p>5. In pages 107, 108, 109 and 110,
are some interesting notices of the
Mangel Wurtzel, or Scarcity or Beet
root, by Mr. Isaac C. Jones, of Philadelphia.
It appears that this gentleman
was led into some experiments,
after an entire city occupation of 20
years, by reading some interesting
accounts of such experiments in the
European books. In April, 1816, a
piece of ground, not quite one fifth
of an acre, was planted with the seeds,
in parallel rows, of two feet three or
four inches one way, by one foot the
other. On gathering the crop in November,
1816, it was found that it
weighed 8180 pounds, and that the
weight of the leaves, pulled off from
those roots, at different times through
the season, was 5,595 pounds. They
would have been more, but as the season
of 1816 was uncommonly dry,
the pulling was omitted for some
weeks. This plant is very valuable
for farm stock, and <em>most so for milch
cows</em>. The leaves are excellent
through the summer, and the cut or
chopped root through the winter,
when dry food is used. The Mangel
Wurtzel, or Scarcity root or improved
Beet, is excellent for the table,
and is preferred by Mr. Jones' family
to the red or garden beets, which are
abundant and very fine in the Philadelphia
market. The same gentleman
raised in 1816, on 23 square poles
(<sup><small>23</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>160</small></sub>ths of an acre,) 110 bushels of
the long or orange Carrot root, being
at the rate of nearly 800 bushels to
the acre. A bushel of those Carrots
(cut with an approved instrument in
the form of an S) weighed 47 lbs.,
and a bushel of the Mangel Wurtzel,
cut in like manner, weighed 55 lbs.
The Carrots produced 800 bushels,
and the Mangel Wurtzel, at this rate,
900 bushels to the acre, each <em>in the
uncut state</em>. As he planted the Mangel
Wurtzel, Mr. Jones found it easy
to dress with the plough and one
horse. The Carrots, when up, require
the hoe and the hand altogether.
It appears, that the seeds of this plant,
about which the utmost care is necessary,
may be had of John S. Skinner,
Esq. Baltimore, and Mr. M'Mahon,
Philadelphia, and of the seedsmen
in New York, Hartford, Boston, &amp;c.
The Mangel Wurtzel fell into some
disrepute in England, about the year
1810, but the marchioness of Salisbury
revived it. It was introduced into
Ireland, in 1787, by seed from Dr.
Letsom, of London, but the good
qualities not being known, nor the
culture, it fell into disuse in Ireland
also. But a machine for the planting
of it was invented by Mr. Edward Linsey,
and now it is extensively cultivated
there and much approved. The
leaves produce two or more crops in
the north of Ireland in summer and
autumn, and those leaves and the roots
in winter are deemed excellent for
milch and beef cattle, in that great
butter country. Irish sowing time is
April and May. Preparation the same
as for turnips and potatoes: two drills
to be opened two feet apart; sufficient
dung to be used, according to the
state and quality of the ground. Then
cover the dung with the double mould
board plough, at once, or the single
plough at twice, by ridging them up
as high as can be well done, with a
man shovelling between the drills,
right and left, smoothing the surface
of the dung, which will leave the
ridge about a space of ten or twelve
inches broad. This complete method
of fallowing will repay the trouble of
shovelling, by raising a full proportion
of earth under the roots. When
the ground is thus completely prepared,
two boys or girls can sow from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
two to three acres per day. After
sowing, it should be well rolled, which
completes the process.</p>

<p>The crop is afterwards to be treated
in the same manner as turnips or
potatoes, by putting to and taking off
mould, &amp;c. After the roots have been
raised, the ground is in fine order for
wheat or any other crop.</p>

<p><i>Example of Cultivation.</i>&mdash;Wolf
M'Neil, Esq. Ireland, sowed one acre;
from the leaves, fed 40 pigs through
the seasons of last summer and fall;
then gathered 84 tons of roots.&mdash;On
these fed nine cows and five
calves during winter, and had, on 22d
April, 1815, eight tons remaining,
besides 100 roots, which he transplanted
for securing good seed, <em>an all-important
object</em> in this culture.</p>

<h3>II. <i>On Root Crops.</i></h3>


<p>Premiums having been proposed to encourage
the raising of Carrots, Rutga Baga
and Mangel Wurtzel; and as these articles,
cultivated extensively, are of vast importance
to farmers; I can perhaps in no
way better promote the views of the Society,
in their vote before mentioned, than
by describing the methods of cultivating
those roots, which elsewhere have been
practised with great success, but to which,
and indeed to the roots themselves (Carrots
excepted) most of our husbandmen
are strangers.</p>

<p>The introduction of Clover, and subsequently
carrying the culture of the Common
Turnip extensively into the field,
marked distinguished eras in the improvements
of English Husbandry. At a later
period, Carrots were cultivated by some
farmers: and within a few years past, the
Mangel Wurtzel and the Rutga Baga have
become objects of general cultivation. And
now these five articles constitute essential
branches of the highly improved Husbandry
of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Turnips.</span> These for a long
time were raised (and perhaps this practice
is still very general) by sowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
seeds broad-cast, and weeding and thinning
them with hoes, till the plants stood
from a foot to fifteen inches apart. But
the most correct practice appears to be
that of drilling the seeds in rows, thinning
them at the distance of ten or twelve inches
in the rows, and hoeing and keeping
them clear from weeds. And this weak,
watery root has been the principal food of
immense flocks of store sheep, during the
winter; and when plentifully given, only
with the addition of straw, has served to
fatten cattle and sheep for the market.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrots,</span> Even these plants, so long
after they vegetate extremely small, were
also raised from seed sown broad-cast.
But this awkward practice, I believe, has
generally given way to the row-culture,
whether the seeds were sown by hand, or
by the instrument called a drill. In very
rich land, great crops have been raised
where the rows were only from twelve to
fifteen inches apart. The great crop of
752 bushels, weighing eighteen tons and
three quarters raised on one acre, in Salem,
by Erastus Ware, in 1817, was in rows
about sixteen inches apart. The seed was
sown the 14th of May. But I am inclined
to think a preferable mode would be, to
sow the seeds in double rows about ten
inches apart, with intervals of three feet
between the rows, so as to admit a small
plough, as well as the hoe, in their cultivation.
In this case, a deep furrow being
opened by the plough, the manure should
be regularly thrown into it, and covered
by four back furrows, so forming a ridge
over the manure; and this ridge being
laid level with a light harrow, or with
rakes, or if the soil be in fine tilth, by a
light roller, will then be ready to receive
the seed. As soon as the Carrots are
plainly to be seen, they should be hoed and
weeded; or the weeds will soon outstrip
the Carrots (which are of very slow
growth at first) and render their cleansing
vastly more troublesome and laborious.&mdash;They
should also be thinned, to stand single,
and only from three to five inches
apart in the rows; or the roots will be
small, and cost much more time in handling
and topping (cutting or wringing off
the tops) at the time of harvesting them.
The entire crop, too, will doubtless be
smaller than when the plants are thinned
as here recommended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mangel Wurtzel.</span> This plant
yields a much more abundant crop than
the Carrot; and at the same time contains,
in the same quantity or weight of roots, a
great deal more nourishment; whence it
is natural to suppose that it requires a
richer soil than Carrots. I have not made
sufficient trials to enable me to express a
decided opinion on the best mode of cultivating
the Mangel Wurtzel; and will
therefore lay before you the successful
practice, on strong land, in the county of
Essex, in England, as it is stated, from a
recent English publication, by the Philadelphia
Society of Agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Mangel Wurtzel is sometimes called
the Great, or Improved Beet, and Root
of Scarcity; but now, more generally, Mangel
Wurtzel, its German name. The following
is the account of its culture at Bedford,
in Essex.</p>

<p>"It may be proper, in the first place, to
state what is meant by <em>strong land</em>. The
surface soil is loamy, and from four to
twelve inches deep, upon a bed of strong
clay mixed with gravel. It is too heavy,
and generally too wet, in the winter, even
for sheep to eat a crop of turnips on the
ground; and although good turnips are
raised upon it, it is always necessary to
draw them for the sheep, stall-fed cattle, or
cattle in the yards."</p>

<p>"In the middle, or latter end of the
month of April, the furrows are set out
with the plough, two feet apart, and double
ploughed; that is, the plough returns
on the [same] furrow to the point whence
it set out, forming a ridge between each
two furrows."</p>

<p>"Double ploughing with a common
plough is preferable to single ploughing
with a double mould board plough, because
it affords a greater depth of loose earth
than the double mould board plough would
produce."</p>

<p>"In these furrows, the manure, which
should be in a rotten state, is deposited,
after the rate of six cubic yards to an
acre."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<p>"The ridges are then split by the
plough, going and returning the same way
as before mentioned; leaving the manure
immediately under the middle of the new
ridges. A light roller is then passed along
the ridges,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in the middle of which the
seed is dibbled, so that the plants may receive
all the benefit which can be derived
from the manure."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"The seed is deposited about an inch
deep, whilst the moisture is fresh in the
earth,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and covered by drawing a garden
rake along the rows. After this, the light
roller is again passed along the ridges, [to
press the earth upon the seeds] and the
work is finished."</p>

<p>"When the plants are about the size of
a radish, they are hoed with a turnip hoe,
leaving the plants in the row about twelve
inches apart. If any of the seeds fail, and
there happen not to be an even crop, the
roots where they are too thick are drawn
out before the hoeing takes place, and
transplanted to fill up the vacant places,
and ensure a full crop; which is always
certain, inasmuch as 99 plants out of 100
thrive and do well. In transplanting, care
is necessary to prevent the point of the
root from turning upwards."</p>

<p>"The weeds, while the plants are young,
are kept hoed; but after the head of the
plant has once spread, no weed can live
under its shade; and the expense of hoeing
afterwards is trifling indeed."</p>

<p>"The whole of the crop is taken up in
the month of November,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in dry weather.
The tops are cut off near the <em>crown</em> of the
plants, and the plants, when perfectly dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
are piled up in a shed, and covered with
straw sufficiently thick to preserve them
from the frost. They kept last year till
the latter end of March, and they would
have kept much longer."</p>

<p>"Where a field selected for a crop of
Beet [the Mangel Wurtzel] happens to be
in a foul state, the seed had better be sown
in a garden, and the whole field planted
with the young Beet, when of the size of
a radish. This will give time for cleaning
the ground, and fitting it for a crop; for
although the Beets are destroyers of
weeds, it is not meant to recommend sowing
them on foul ground, or in any way to
encourage a slovenly system of farming."</p>

<p>"The method of cultivating the Beet
root, here recommended, is the same as
that used in the cultivation of turnips, in
Northumberland, and other parts of the
North of England with this exception,
that the rows there are 27 inches apart.&mdash;There
may be reasons in the North for still
preserving that space; but in Essex the
effect of it, in the cultivation of the Beet
root, would be, that instead of 48 tons per
acre, 43 tons only would be obtained. Experience
has proved, that the roots do not
get to a larger size in rows three feet
apart, than they do in rows two feet apart.
It may therefore fairly be presumed, that
they would not be larger, in rows twenty-seven
inches apart; and if not larger, the
weight of the crop, per acre, must be less,
because the plants decrease in number as
the rows increase in space."</p>

<p>To the preceding account of cultivating
the Mangel Wurtzel, I will subjoin a few</p>


<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>In this mode it is intended that every
two feet of ground should bear one plant:
and as an acre contains 43,560 square feet,
there will be half of that number of plants
on an acre, and the roots must weigh nearly
five pounds each, on an average, to yield
forty-eight tons. The land must indeed
be strong to produce so heavy a crop. If
our lands, enriched and prepared in the
best manner conveniently in our power,
can be made to yield half as much, we
shall have reason to be satisfied: especially
as the Mangel Wurtzel, quantity for
quantity, contains more than twice as much
nutritive matter as the Ruta Baga, and
even 50 per cent. more than Carrots; according
to the experiments (by analysis)
of a celebrated English Chymist, Sir Humphrey
Davy, which he stated to the British
Board of Agriculture. These experiments
were made with the red and white Beets;
but it is presumed that the Mangel Wurtzel
produces as much nutriment as any other
Beet.</p>

<p>Instead of 6 it may be advisable to apply
at least 12 cubit yards (that is 6 such cart
loads as were before-mentioned) of manure
to an acre; and to distribute the same in
deep furrows 4 feet apart. This would give
four square feet of ground to each plant,
the plants being at a foot distance one
from another in the rows, four feet apart,
would admit the use of the common horse
plough in their cultivation.</p>

<p>Carrots and the Mangel Wurtzel possess
one eminent advantage; that they are not,
to my knowledge, annoyed by insects at
any period of their growth. Whereas the
Ruta Baga and other turnips, while in the
seed leaf, are injured (in England whole
fields are often destroyed) by a small black
fly: and the Ruta Baga (like cabbages)
when far advanced in growth, is sometimes
infested, and in dry seasons half ruined, by
plant lice; as was my small crop in 1818.</p>

<p>The Mangel Wurtzel also possesses one
peculiar advantage above all other root
crops, that as soon as the tops or leaves,
are full grown, they may be stripped off
(leaving only the small heart-leaves uninjured)
and given to cattle and swine.&mdash;This
stripping may be repeated once
or twice; and it is said that the roots
thrive better for the stripping. If not
stripped off many of the under leaves
perish. The leaves are pronounced excellent
for increasing the richness and
quantity of milk in cows; and so are calculated
to supply the deficiency of herbage
in the common pastures, which generally
fail, more or less, by the beginning of August.
An acre twice stripped will yield
several tons of leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ruta Baga.</span> This root may be
cultivated in the manner just described for
the Mangel Wurtzel; the ground being
prepared in the same manner. In England,
they appear to be most commonly
grown in rows 27 inches apart, with the
plants at a foot distance in the rows. But
William Cobbett, who in a small book,
published in New York, has minutely described
his own practice, both in England
and America, asserts, that the largest crops
are attainable by growing the Ruta Baga
in rows four feet apart, with the plants
about 10 inches or a foot distant from each
other in the rows: and in this mode of
culture, he has raised, in England, 30 tons
to the acre.</p>

<p>For this mode of culture, the manure,
being deposited in furrows 4 feet apart, is
covered by 4 back furrows, 2 on one side
and 2 on the other, of each line of manure;
by which little ridges are formed:
and if the ploughing be deep (as it ought
to be) there will be a deep gutter between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
every two ridges.&mdash;The tops of the ridges
being made fine with a light harrow, or with
rakes, the seeds are sown with a drilling
machine; or by hand, which Mr. Cobbett
says he prefers to a drill. Two men sowed
for him 7 acres in 3 days, using about
4 pounds of seed, in this manner; a man
went along by the side of each ridge, and
put down 2 or 3 seeds in places at about
10 inches from each other, just drawing a
little earth over, and <em>pressing it on the seed</em>,
in order to make it vegetate quickly, before
the earth became too dry. But, he
adds, the 7 acres might have been sown by
one man in a day, by just scattering the
seeds along on the top of the ridge, where
they might have been buried with a rake,
and pressed down with a spade or shovel,
or other flat instrument. But he used a
light roller, to take two ridges at once, the
horse walking in the gutter between.</p>

<p>The time of sowing the seeds must vary
with the climate. On Long Island, (state
of New York) Mr. Cobbett's trials of one
year led him to prefer the 26th of June;
but in our own county, I would not pass
the middle of that month. Indeed I think
it expedient (in order to ascertain the fittest
time) to commence sowing the seed
as soon as the ground can be prepared after
the planting of Indian corn, and to continue
to sow, in small plots, weekly, until
the middle of June.</p>

<p>As soon as the plants are fairly up, hoes
and the fingers are to be used, taking out
all the plants but 1 in each 10 or 12 inches.
As soon as weeds appear, hoeing is to commence;
hoeing the tops of the ridges to
the width of about 6 inches, showing the
plants distinct and clean. Then the plough
is introduced, taking a furrow from the
side of one ridge, going up the field, a
furrow from the other ridge coming down,
then another furrow from the same side of
the first ridge going up, and another furrow
from the same side of the other ridge
coming down. In taking away the last
two furrows, you go within three inches of
the turnip plants. Thus a ridge is formed
over the original gutter. The next process
is, to turn these furrows back again
to the turnips. This hoeing and ploughing
is to be repeated, when the appearance of
the weeds requires it; and afterwards, the
few weeds which may rise are to be hoed
or pulled up. In this way, Mr. Cobbett
thinks, a thousand bushels of Ruta Baga
may be raised on an acre that will yield 50
bushels of Indian corn.</p>

<p>In describing the culture of the Mangel
Wurtzel, transplanting was mentioned, to
fill vacant places. The same may be practised
with the Ruta Baga. But unless
those vacant spots be dug afresh, the transplanted
roots will be much inferiour to
their transplanted neighbours; as I found
in my last year's experiment. And Mr.
Cobbett mentions the like difference in
his practice.&mdash;At the same time he strongly
recommends the raising of the Ruta Baga,
by <em>transplanting</em>, for <em>entire crops</em>, as for preferable
to the sowing of the seeds, and letting
the plants grow where their seeds
first vegetated. But then he considers it
indispensable to perform this transplanting
<em>on ground fresh ploughed</em>. And by sowing
the seeds in beds, to raise plants, as we
do for cabbages, a month's more time is
allowed to prepare the ground for their
reception. In the work of transplanting,
the plain dibble before described is a
necessary instrument. The hole made
by it must be fully as deep as the length
of the root; and this being introduced
(taking care in putting it into the hole not
to bend its point) the dibble is thrust
down by its side, and by a dexterous twist,
or circular motion of the hand, the earth
is pressed close against the root, in its
whole length. The largest crop of Ruta
Baga he ever raised in England, Mr. Cobbett
says, was by transplanting, on 17 acres,
which produced 33 tons to the acre; the
rows (on ridges) 4 feet asunder, and the
plants a foot asunder in the rows.</p>

<p>In this mode of raising the Ruta Baga,
by transplanting the entire crop, so much
time is gained for preparing the ground,
that two crops of weeds may be destroyed,
by that number of ploughings; the
first in the beginning of June, and the
second immediately before transplanting.
But Mr. Cobbett recommends a previous
<em>deep</em> fall-ploughing, and another <em>deep</em>
ploughing in April, of the ground intended
for the Ruta Baga. The like two
deep ploughings will be equally proper and
beneficial for the Mangel Wurtzel and
Carrots.</p>

<p>Among the advantages of the transplanting
method, mentioned by Mr. Cobbett,
one is, that it "saves almost the whole of
the <em>after culture</em>. There is no <em>hoeing</em>, no
<em>thinning</em> of the plants; and not more than
one ploughing between the ridges."</p>

<p><i>Harvesting of Roots.</i> The Mangel Wurtzel,
growing chiefly above the surface, and
thus exposed to frost, should be taken up
the latter end of October or beginning of
November, according to the nature of the
season. The harvesting of Carrots may
follow that of the Mangel Wurtzel; and
the Ruta Baga succeed the Carrots. In
the first experimental culture of the roots,
in which but small quantities are raised,
they can be preserved in dry cellars not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
liable to freezing. Where large quantities
are raised, they may be deposited in
heaps, sufficiently covered, in a dry field.
The common method of heaping and covering
roots in the field, and which Mr.
Cobbett practised with the Ruta Baga, is
perhaps, as good as any. Holes of a round
or square form are dug about a foot deep,
and about fifty bushels are put into each,
piling up the roots above the level of the
surface of the land, sloping to the top:
then covering them with straw, throw
earth over the whole to a depth sufficient
to guard them from frost. Smooth the
surface of this earth by beating it close
with the back of a spade, or other instrument,
the better to cast off rain. On Long
Island and in Pennsylvania, a covering of
earth, a foot or 15 inches deep has been
found sufficient. A greater depth will
probably be necessary here. In throwing
up this cover, a trench will be formed on
all sides of the heap, to receive the water
running off it. It may be well to sink the
bottom of the trench lower than the bottom
of the hole in which the roots are deposited.
Where large quantities are to be
thus preserved, several loads may be put
into one hole: and then oblong heaps will
be best as requiring less labour in covering
them. A quantity of roots, for feeding
cattle till the middle of December, may be
kept in a barn or stable covered with
straw or any dry litter. I would begin
feeding with Mangel Wurtzel&mdash;follow next
with Carrots&mdash;and conclude with Ruta
Baga; for the latter root will keep sound
until the commencement of the summer
succeeding their growth.</p>

<p>All the roots, especially the Mangel
Wurtzel and Carrots, should be fully dried
before they are housed, or covered in the
field, to guard them against rotting.</p>

<p><i>Roots for raising Seed.</i> Of the Mangel
Wurtzel I would select large and fair roots
of a red colour, whose bodies have grown
most above ground, and with a moderate,
if not the smallest, quantity of leaves; for
although <em>these</em> are valuable for stripping,
the <em>roots</em> are much more valuable; and I
am inclined to think those with small tops
are least liable to rot.</p>

<p>Of Carrots, large and fair roots of the
deepest yellow colour, and with the smallest
tops in proportion to the size of the
roots, are to be preferred.</p>

<p>With regard to the Ruta Baga, Mr. Cobbett
says, it is apt to <em>degenerate</em>, if the seed
be not saved with care. "We in England
(said he) examine well to find out those
that run least into <em>neck</em> and <em>green</em>.
We reject all such as approach at all towards a
<em>whitish</em> colour, or which are even of a
<em>greenish</em> colour <em>towards the neck</em>, which
<em>there</em> ought to be a little of a <em>reddish cast</em>."</p>

<p>Varieties of plants of the <em>same kind</em> (the
different sorts of cabbages, for instance, or
of Indian corn) if growing near together
and bearing seed, will impart to one another
their respective peculiarities, and
injuriously, whenever it is desired to preserve
their distinct qualities unmixed, and
to prevent an inferiour engendering with
one of a superiour quality; the impregnating
dust of the flowers of plants falling
on the flowers of other plants of the same
kind, producing effects similar to the crossing
of animals of the same kind but of different
breeds. In a word, the <em>sexual</em> system
exists in plants as well as among animals;
only in plants the male and female
are generally united in the same plant; as
in Indian corn, the male impregnating dust
(the farina) is in the tassel or flower, at the
top: the ear is the female, and from every
cell of the future grain proceeds a thread,
which together constitute what is called
the silk, on which the farina falling causes
the cells to fill, and become, when ripe,
kernels of corn. In most fruits, as the
apple and pear, the male and female are in
the same flower. But in hemp, some of
the plants are exclusively male, and others
exclusively female.</p>

<p>The Ruta Baga, therefore, when set out
for bearing seed, should be placed at a
distance from every other seed plant of
the Turnip or Cabbage kind. So likewise
the Mangel Wurtzel intended to bear
seed, should not be set near any other seed
beet plants. It may not be amiss to add,
that for the same reasons, pumpkins,
squashes, melons, cucumbers, in all their
varieties, in order to preserve them in purity,
should be planted at some distance
from each other.</p>

<p>Pumpkins, as food for domestic animals,
seem closely connected with the roots
before-mentioned. Every farmer knows
their value for milk cows, for fattening
cattle, and for swine. Their consumption
conveniently precedes that of the Mangel
Wurtzel.</p>

<p>With ample supplies of the Vegetables
whose culture I have mentioned and described,
our present Stocks may be better
fed, their numbers enlarged, our coarse
fodder be more advantageously consumed,
our manure increased, and pork and beef
and the products of the dairy, probably
doubled. The latter, in particular, are
miserably deficient, from the want of juicy
food for cows, in continuance of the supply
yielded by our common pastures just at
midsummer. Pumpkins and the roots, indeed,
will not be ready to keep up that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
supply; but oats and barley, and above all
Indian corn, may be sown and planted, to
be cut green, and carry along our cows to
the last of September, when pumpkins will
begin to ripen. The consumption of these
green crops and roots, by producing vast
additions to our manure, will enable us to
enrich our fields, and to make annual additions
to the products of our farms.</p>

<p>The immense importance of providing for
cows a full supply of food, and of food which
they relish, to the extent of their appetites,
has been demonstrated by many examples
of very large products of milk, butter and
cheese, from cows so supplied. The following
statement from a recent English
publication, is a further illustration of the
fact:&mdash;"A farmer, some years since, kept
<em>eighteen</em> cows upon a <em>Common</em>, and was often
obliged to buy butter for his family.
The Common was <em>enclosed</em>, (which deprived
the farmer of his pasture,) and the same
person supplied his family amply with milk
and butter, from <em>four</em> cows <em>well kept.</em>"</p>


<h3><i>III. On Indian Corn and Winter Grain.</i></h3>

<p>The ancient, and to this day the general
practice, in cultivating Indian corn, has
been to plant it in squares, and in the
course of its growth to draw up earth about
the stems of the plants, forming <em>hills</em>; under
the idea of supporting them against
strong winds; but the necessity or utility
of this practice has long been doubted. I
have sometimes cultivated Indian corn
without raising any hills about the plants;
and, from the result, am satisfied that hills
are not necessary. If, indeed, winter
wheat, or rye, is to be sown among the
corn, at its last dressing, I think the hilling
must be injurious; for the richer mould being
drawn up into hills, the intervals are
robbed of what is requisite to produce an
even crop.</p>

<p>I am aware that some intelligent farmers
consider it bad husbandry to sow winter
grain among Indian corn&mdash;to <em>double-crop</em>
the ground. But if this be <em>rich</em>, and in
<em>fine tilth</em> by deep ploughing before the corn
crop is put in, and good and clean tillage
accompanying its growth, I can perceive
no solid objection to the practice. With
us, the early sowing of winter grain is of
the first importance, to insure a full crop,
early ripe, and most secure from mildew.
The husbandry of Mr. Ducket, already described,
justifies the practice. I know it
is already common amongst us; but without
the <em>deep tillage</em> which enabled him to
put in seven crops with only four ploughings.
With such complete tillage, of a
soil so enriched as to yield forty or fifty
bushels of Indian corn to the acre, grown
on a level, without hills or ridges; and if,
in harvesting the corn, it be cut close to
the ground; I see no reason why grass
seeds may not properly be sown on the
winter grain, in the spring. In this way,
may be obtained a crop of Indian corn the
first year&mdash;a crop of wheat or rye the second
year&mdash;and hay the third and fourth
years; and all from one deep ploughing,
and a handsome culture of the Indian
corn.</p>

<p>By the early sowing of winter grain
among Indian corn, it quickly vegetates,
and sends forth numerous branches; and
soon covering the ground, prevents or
checks the growth of weeds. Probably,
too, the plants, acquiring so much strength
by early sowing (for the roots must multiply
and extend in proportion to the growth
above ground) are less liable to be winter-killed.</p>


<h3><i>IV. On Live Stock.</i></h3>

<p>I have now to present to your notice the
other of the three celebrated English Farmers,
described by Arthur Young&mdash;Mr.
Bakewell&mdash;the most distinguished improver
of live stock, on principles of his own, in
Great Britain. "The principles he began
upon (says Mr. Young) were <em>fine forms</em>,
<em>small bones</em>, <em>and a true disposition to make
readily fat</em>, which is indeed inseparable
from small bones, or rather fine bones, and
fine forms, or true symmetry of the parts."
Before Bakewell's day, the rules which
governed Breeders of Live Stock, Mr.
Young pronounces a tissue "of absurdities."</p>

<p>He began his improvements of sheep,
by selecting from the best in his neighbourhood.
And so little had any correct
principle of improvement been known, or
regarded, that a guinea or half a guinea
extraordinary would give Mr. Bakewell
the choice of any sheep in any flock. And
his uncommon sagacity enabled him, by
the best selections and judicious crossings,
to form a breed distinguished above all
others, for <em>the disposition to fatten</em>, <em>early maturity</em>,
<em>a form indicating strength of constitution</em>,
<em>weight in the most valuable parts</em>, with
<em>lightness of offals</em>. Mr. Young expresses
his opinion, that there is not a breed of
any sort of live stock in Great Britain, that
does not derive its improvement from the
skill, knowledge and principles of Mr.
Bakewell. Another eminent Agriculturalist
declares, (and Mr. Young does not
think he exaggerates) "that Mr. Bakewell
enabled those who followed his ideas, to
produce two pounds of mutton where only
one was produced before."</p>

<p>Mr. Young adds, that Bakewell was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
most careful feeder of stock that he ever
met with, and who made his food go the
farthest. To horses and cattle in stalls, he
did not permit more than a handful of hay
to be given at a time; and the same economy
was used in all other feeding.&mdash;But his
stocks were so large as to require one or
more persons to be appropriated to that
service. This practice, in our small farms
and with our small stocks, cannot be fully
adopted; but it may be imitated, in some
degree, during the season (winter) most
requiring such attention. By feeding them
in this manner, the cattle will doubtless
<em>eat more</em>, but they will <em>waste less</em>; so that
while, in the whole, no more fodder will
be consumed, the stock will be put into
much better plight.</p>

<p>Cleanliness, also, will materially contribute
to the health and thriving of stock.
The common cattle-stalls of our country
are so ill contrived, and so straitened in
their dimensions, that the cattle are constrained
to lie down, in part in their own
dung. This dries and forms a thick coat
on their hind quarters, from which they
are not relieved till they shed their hair in
the spring. They are thus rendered <em>uncomfortable</em>;
to be <em>uncomfortable</em> is to suffer
some degree of <em>pain</em>; and no one will
suppose that animals in <em>pain</em> can <em>thrive</em>, or
<em>preserve their plight</em>, with the same food,
equally with others perfectly at ease.
Even hogs, though prone to wallow in the
mire, in warm weather, are always pleased
with a dry bed, and thrive best when kept
clean. I have some where read an account
of an experiment made with two, confined
in separate pens, and fed exactly alike:
one was suffered to be constantly foul with
the mire of his sty; the other, washed
every day, and kept clean, far outstripped
the former in thriving.</p>

<p>It may be useful to add some further information
on Live Stock, from the writings
of Sir John Sinclair, President of the British
Board of Agriculture. He proposed
to a gentleman in England,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who is eminent
for his knowledge and accurate observations
relative to plants and animals,
some questions concerning Live Stock. In
one of his answers, he says&mdash;"I have found
the food animals generally require, to keep
them in proper condition, is much more
nearly proportioned to their <em>height</em> and
<em>length</em>, than to their <em>weight</em>." In confirmation
of this opinion, he adds, that one of
his neighbours made a comparative experiment
with the Devon and Hereford cows;
and though fond of the former for their
neatness, he gave them up, because "they
would not nearly live upon the same food
which supplied animals <em>stouter</em> and <em>more
compact</em>, of the same weight."</p>

<p>To the question, "What is the best
shape for feeding with little food?" Mr.
Knight answers&mdash;"The more deep and
capacious the chest, and the shorter and
lower any animal is, relative to its weight,
the better adapted it will be to live and
fatten upon little food; the more labour it
will also go through; and I have always
found the short legged oxen to be the best
labourers. Mr. Marshall also observes, in
his Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, that
the best labouring ox he ever saw, had the
shortest legs."</p>

<p>I will detain the Society no longer than
to make a few observations.</p>


<h3><i>V. On Orchards.</i></h3>

<p>I advert to this subject for the purpose
of suggesting the utility of propagating
Sweet Apples.</p>

<p>After providing a due proportion of apples
for the table, and the ordinary purposes
of cookery, I do not hesitate to express
my opinion, that for all other uses,
sweet apples are entitled to the preference.
The best cider I ever tasted in this
country, was made wholly of sweet apples.
They afford also a nourishing food to man
and all domestic animals. What furnishes
a more delicate repast than a rich sweet
apple baked and eaten with milk? I recollect
the observation made to me by an
observing farmer, before the American
revolution, that nothing would fatten cattle
faster than sweet apples. Mentioning this,
a few years since, to a gentleman of my acquaintance
in an adjoining state, he informed
me, that he was once advised to
give sweet apples to a sick horse. Happening
then to have them in plenty, the
horse was served with them, and he soon
got well: and continuing to be fed with
them, he fattened faster than any other
horse he had ever owned (and he had
owned many) that was fed with any other
food.</p>

<p>Mentioning to the same gentleman, what
I had long before heard, that a good molasses
might be made of sweet apples, he
confirmed the fact by an instance within
his own knowledge: and further expressed
his opinion (and I have not known a
man whose practical judgment was entitled
to more respect) that it would not be difficult,
by forming orchards of sweet apples,
to supply molasses for the general consumption
of the United States. I have never
tasted any sweet apple molasses; but
I suppose it has not (nor has honey) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
rich sweet of molasses from the sugar-cane;
yet, for family uses in general, it
would be a useful substitute for the latter.
The process in making it I suppose to be
very simple.&mdash;The apples being ground,
and the juice (or cider) expressed, at the
cider-mill, it is immediately boiled, (that
is, before any fermentation takes place)
and the scum being taken off as it rises,
the boiling is continued until the liquor acquires
the consistence of molasses.</p>

<p>Sweet apples are of different degrees of
sweetness. Those of the richest kinds
should be chosen for the purpose of making
molasses. But in grafting, the cions should
be taken (as they ought to be for all kinds
of fruit) not from old, worn out trees, but
from those whose originals are in full health
and vigour.&mdash;For it has been satisfactorily
ascertained in England, (and proofs of it
are not wanting in our own country) that
fruit trees have their infancy, (springing
from seeds) youth, maturity, and old age;
and that when they have reached this last
stage, it is in vain that attempts are made
to continue them. Or if the cions take,
and grow for a few years, they are unproductive,
and soon decay. The reason is
plain: every cion is a part of the tree from
which it is taken; and if this be in a state
of decrepitude, so will be the cion; and although
grafted on a youthful, thrifty stock,
it will be of no avail.</p>

<h2>NEW WHEAT.</h2>

<p class="center">(From the Plough Boy.)</p>

<h2>FLEMISH HUSBANDRY.</h2>


<p><i>Weeding and hoeing.</i>&mdash;The Flemish
farmer never considers his work
half done until his fields are completely
freed from weeds. This is effected,
in a great measure, by repeated
digging, by which the upper stratum
that contains the seeds and roots of
noxious plants, is buried sufficiently
deep into the ground to prevent their
vegetating. When weeds do appear,
they are immediately extirpated either
by the harrow before the grain is sown,
or afterwards by careful and repeated
hand hoeings. This they find the
more necessary, to rid the earth of
parasite plants, the seeds of which
are mixed with the seeds of culinary
vegetables, and produce plants that
feed on the juices of the dung, to the
great injury of the legitimate stock.
A Flemish farm, in consequence of
these attentions, resembles more a
highly cultivated garden, than many
places which bear that name. When
I first beheld these fields, I supposed
them actually to be gardens, and was
only undeceived when further observation
and inquiry convinced me, that
the whole country was cultivated in a
similar manner, and presented the
same delightful scene.</p>

<p><i>Choice of Seeds.</i>&mdash;It is an invariable
practice in Flanders, never to use
for seed the grain grown on the land
to be sown; nor is the expense regarded
when the object is to obtain
heavy and healthy seed. Farmers in
distant districts exchange seeds with
each other, and journies of hundreds
of miles are frequently taken to accomplish
this desirable purpose. Vanderstractan
mentions two farmers,
whose grounds were alike, and who
cultivated them with equal skill and
industry. They had both been long
in the practice of procuring excellent
seed potatoes from Brabant, which
yielded in that province two hundred
cwt. per English acre. When transplanted,
the produce was regularly,
year after year, five hundred and forty
cwt. per acre.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> One of these men
having, one year, to save the expense
of carriage, used potatoes of his own
growth, the original produce of Brabant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
soon repented the step, and returned
to his former practice. Flanders
usually receives its supply of
flax-seed from the north of Europe;
but having, during the latter years of
the reign of Napoleon, been deprived
of that supply, through his restrictive
decrees; the produce of that valuable
plant was not more than half the usual
quantity, which besides was greatly
inferior to preceding crops.</p>

<p>Although the Flemish are the most
particular people in the world as to
the choice of their seeds, they are
sometimes deceived. An instance of
this happened a few years ago, which
was followed by very injurious consequences.
A person brought some
flax-seed from Riga, which he sold
for sound seed. It was, however, superanuated,
but he had contrived to
give it a fresh and healthy appearance,
and thus imposed on the best
judges. The farmers, deceived by
the false mark, bought and sowed the
seed, none of which ever appeared
above the ground. "The desolation
of the country was universal; the loss
was estimated at several millions of
florins; and the offender escaped the
punishment he merited, only through
the intercessions of several powerful
friends, who found means to stifle the
affair, notwithstanding the cries of its
numerous victims." I recollect a case
somewhat similar to this, which happened
a few years ago in Edinburgh.
A respectable seed merchant there
purchased a quantity of flax-seed from
a foreigner, which he sold again in
small parcels to the farmers, who, on
sowing it, found that it was unsound,
as no part of it was productive. The
seed merchant was sued, and although
he distinctly proved, that he made the
purchase himself under the impression
that the seed was fresh, and paid
a fair price for it, he was found liable
in damages to the amount of the loss
sustained by the farmer who sued,
upon the ground that he was bound
to guarantee every article which he
sold at the regular market price, whether
he was imposed upon himself or
not. These lessons were not thrown
away. In Flanders, as well as in Scotland,
no foreign seed is purchased,
until the purchasers be fully satisfied
as to the quality of the article, and the
character of the seller.</p>

<p>The Flemish practice, with regard
to a change of seeds, has long prevailed
in Scotland, not only as to potatoes,
but as to wheat, barley, oats,
and all other grain. The Scotch potatoes
have always appeared to me
superior to those raised in England,
where the same attention is not shown
to the choice of seed. It is a fact,
also, well known in these countries,
that the barley raised in Scotland,
though greatly inferior in <em>appearance</em>
to English barley, and raised in a
colder climate, contains more saccharine
matter, or nourishment. This
has been tested by experiments at the
distilleries, under the immediate inspection
of officers appointed by the
government, who reported a greater
quantity of spirit obtained from barley,
the growth of Scotland, than from
that produced in England. The beef
sold in the London markets, which
had been reared in the Scotch distilleries
upon the refuse grains, uniformly
sells at from three to four cents
a pound more than that fed at any of
the English distilleries.</p>

<p>This superiority unquestionably arises
from the greatly improved system
of agriculture, <em>generally</em> introduced
into Scotland, but it is owing in
nothing so much as to the very scrupulous
attention there paid to the
choice of seed. Of late years, this
branch of husbandry seems to have
considerably attracted the notice of
the English farmers; some of whom,
as appears from the English newspapers,
have found it greatly to their
interest to cultivate wheat, in particular,
obtained from foreign places,
which, when grown, they convey to
distant parts of the country, and sell
exclusively for seed wheat. It was
mentioned in the Cumberland Packet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
(an English journal) of 14th October,
1816, "that a farmer had obtained
<i>l.</i>40, ($170,) per load, of 30 bushels,
for seed wheat, on account of its great
product. He had also, obtained the
same price for seven years past for
this wheat, which had been originally
imported from abroad."</p>

<p><i>Rotation of Crops</i>&mdash;The intelligent
agriculturalists of England are well
aware, that the more the rotation of
crops are varied, the more abundant
is their produce; but this opinion is
confined to a few in that country. It
is only in Flanders that the idea of exhausting
the soil, by repeated cropping,
is exploded, and the rotation system
brought to the greatest possible state
of perfection. The ground being prepared
in the manner before stated, the
Flemish farmer adopts either one or
the other of the following courses:</p>


<h3>FIRST COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.</h3>

<p><i>First year.</i>&mdash;Oats are sown about
the end of February, or beginning of
March. These are cut green toward
the end of April, or beginning of May,
and given to the cattle for food, which
they eat with great pleasure. It is
found that this crop, as it is not allowed
to throw out the ears, does not
exhaust the soil, or take anything from
the subsequent crop.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Winter potatoes
are now sown for a <em>second</em> crop;
previous to which the land is dug and
manured. When of a middling size
the potato is planted whole, but if
very large, the eye only is used.</p>

<p><i>Second year.</i>&mdash;Wheat forms the first
crop; and scarcely are the sheaves removed
from the ground, when the
farmer promptly turns up the earth,
and sows spurry. Sometimes carrots
are sown with the wheat.</p>

<p><i>Third year.</i>&mdash;Rye; which is followed
by Turnips.</p>


<h3>SECOND COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.</h3>

<p><i>First year.</i>&mdash;Flax preceded by
green oats. After the flax, carrots.</p>

<p><i>Second year.</i>&mdash;-Wheat; followed by
Spurry.</p>

<p><i>Third year.</i>&mdash;Rye and turnips.</p>


<h3>THIRD COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.</h3>

<p><i>First year.</i>&mdash;Female Hemp; after
which, Turnips.</p>

<p><i>Second year.</i>&mdash;Flax, then carrots.</p>

<p><i>Third year.</i>&mdash;Wheat and spurry.</p>


<h3>FOURTH COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.</h3>

<p><i>First year.</i>&mdash;Flax, preceded by
green corn. After the flax, carrots.</p>

<p><i>Second year.</i>&mdash;Cole-seed; then turnips.</p>

<p><i>Third year.</i>&mdash;Wheat; then spurry.</p>

<p>These courses are sufficient to give
a pretty correct idea of the Flemish
system of rotation. It will be seen
that wheat never succeeds to clover:
it almost always follows flax, hemp,
cole-seed or potatoes. Clover greatly
encourages the growth of dog grass,
which, if not completely torn up, with
all its roots, the least fibres of the latter
which escape, will each produce a
new plant, greatly to the prejudice of
the wheat. In England the fields are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
always more or less infected with this
pest, while the practice pursued in
Flanders completely protects them
against it&mdash;Wheat is also materially
benefited in Flanders, by the repeated
digging up, and hoeings, which potatoes
require; and by the abundance,
and judicious application of manure,
spread during the first year of the
course. This loses only part of its
fertilizing salts, leaving the earth in a
high state of fertility, which the Flemish
farmer knows well how to augment
to the requisite degree without
causing the wheat to shed; a circumstance
apt to occur, where too great a
quantity of manure is used.</p>

<p>The following comparative tables,
shewing the value which is obtained
from one acre in <em>four</em> years, by a farmer,
following the Norfolk course, in
England, and that obtained, from the
same space in <em>three</em> years according
to the Flemish course, will best illustrate
the superior advantages of the
latter over the former:</p>

<p>Giving one year with another,
<i>l.</i>7 9 1 per acre.</p>

<p>From these statements, proceeding
upon the most correct data, it is seen
that the value of the produce of one
acre of ground, cultivated according
to the Flemish system for <em>three</em> years,
is, (within a fraction,) 50 per cent.
more than what is produced in <em>four</em>
years from an equal space of ground,
managed agreeably to the most approved
principles of English husbandry.
The advantages of the Flemish
farmer, will appear still more striking,
when the nett profit which he clears,
after paying the necessary expenses
of cultivation is contrasted with that
of the English farmer. According to
Arthur Young, the English farmer receives
about four and a half twentieths
of the produce, calculating the gross
produce of the soil at twenty. This
upon <i>l.</i>4 18 6<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>, (the result per acre,
for one year, as in Table I.) would
give <i>l.</i>1 2 1<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>.</p>

<p>The produce, per acre, for one year,
in Flanders (see Table II.) is <i>l.</i>7 9 1;
the expense of cultivation, land tax,
and rent, according to Vanderstraten,
is <i>l.</i>4 0 1; leaving to the farmer
<i>l.</i>3 9 0; or nearly <em>four</em> times the
amount obtained by the English farmer.</p>

<p>The subject of <em>Flemish Husbandry</em>
is by no means exhausted. I shall resume
it in future communications.</p>

<h3>REPORT.</h3>

<p>The Committee appointed by the
Society to propose plans for its adoption,
believing that the objects which
may properly claim the attention of
the Association, are very numerous,
are therefore free to suggest, whether
it would not be advantageous to institute
several standing committees,
each of which should cultivate a particular
department of Agriculture, or
some of the sciences that may minister
to its improvement.</p>

<p>If the Society should approve of
this plan, we propose that these committees
should be made up by voluntary
associations among the members
as far as practicable, each being at liberty
to join himself to such as he may
choose, and all vacancies and deficiences
in the numbers of said committees
should be filled by the presiding
officer. They should in no case consist
of less than five members, whose
names should be entered on the minutes
of the Society; and they should
each have a secretary to receive communications,
to arrange and digest the
scattered materials they may collect,
and to lay before the society such as
may be thought worthy of its attention.</p>

<p>All books, models, drawings, or
specimens, that any of these committees
procure in the course of their labours,
shall be kept in such place as
it should direct.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the formation
of the following standing committees
be authorized at the time&mdash;to be
renewed at the first stated meeting in
each year.</p>

<p>1st. A committee on farm buildings,
fences and implements of husbandry.
To study the improvement
of houses, barns, barn-yards and out
buildings, both as it regards the plan
and materials. To examine the relative
cost of the different kinds of fences,
and the best methods of constructing
or raising them. To make
improvements in the implements of
husbandry, and to introduce such as
may be made in other places.</p>

<p>2d. A committee on the Veterinary
Art&mdash;To investigate the nature and
origin of the diseases of domestic animals,
and endeavour to ascertain the
best methods of prevention and cure.</p>

<p>3d. A committee on Natural History,
particularly Mineralogy and Entomology.
To develope the mineral
productions of the County, and to ascertain
its geological structure, partly
for the purpose of designating the
kind of soil in each neighbourhood.
To examine the habits of such insects
as injure the crops of the farmer, with
a view of discovering the means of destroying
them, or preventing their
ravages; and such other branches of
Natural History as are interesting to
the Agriculturalist.</p>

<p>4th. A committee on Political
Economy. To attend to the political
interests of Agriculture, and examine
the manner in which public measures
affect it. To inquire into the utility
of public improvements, such as canals,
bridges, and turnpike roads, and
into the means of giving the Agricultural
class its due weight in the government.</p>

<p>5th. A committee on Domestic
Animals. To inquire after and introduce
the best kind, to endeavour to
ascertain the most economical and the
best methods of rearing, managing
and feeding them, together with facts
on the relative advantages of the employment
of horses and oxen for labour.</p>

<p>6th. A committee on grasses, grains
and roots. To inquire after and recommend
the best and most profitable
kinds, the time and manner of sowing
and planting, with the most proper
quantity of each per acre, also the previous
preparation of the ground and
seed, together with the best method
of culture.</p>

<p>7th. A committee on Manures.&mdash;To
endeavour to ascertain the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
advantages of barn-yard manure, plaister,
lime, burnt clay, ashes, and all
other kinds of manure, with the time
and manner of application of each,
whether best applied on ploughed or
grass lands, on the surface or ploughed
in, deep or shallow; together with
the best methods of accumulating
and preparing barn-yard and stable
manure.</p>

<p>8th. A committee on fruit and forest
trees.&mdash;To endeavour to ascertain
the best and most useful fruits of all
kinds, with the best method of making
wine, and cider, &amp;c. To examine the
causes of the premature decay of fruit
trees, with a view to their preservation.
To ascertain the best time of
cutting forest trees, as it respects the
durability of the wood, under ground,
or exposed to the weather; also for
fuel.</p>

<p>9th. A committee on irrigation and
draining.&mdash;To ascertain the most profitable
times of irrigation, with its
uses. Also, the best and most effectual
methods of constructing drains.</p>

<p>10th. A committee on Horticulture.&mdash;To
ascertain the best and most
approved methods of managing kitchen
gardens, attend to the introduction
of useful vegetables, modes of culture,
&amp;c.; and also to promote good
taste in the planning and arrangement
of gardens generally.</p>

<p>We further propose that the society
recommend to each of its practical
members, regularly to enter in
writing, the preparation and state of
the ground, at the time of sowing or
planting each crop, the quantity and
kind of manure and seed per acre,
particulars relative to the weather,
the process of culture, the times of
sowing and gathering, and the amount
of produce per acre, with such other
particulars as may be thought worthy
of notice, each part of which to be annually
laid before them, in order that
such facts as are deemed worthy of
preservation, may be laid before the
society.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the members of the
society generally, and such others as
are friendly to the objects of the association,
be requested to furnish the
several committees above named with
such information relative to the subjects
for which they are appointed as
may be in their possession.</p>

<h2>ON THE CULTURE OF TURNIPS.</h2>


<p>Turnips for fall and winter use are
generally sown in the last of July. I
have been long apprehensive that this
sowing was too early. The weather
at this season of the year is generally
very hot and very dry; and drought
has a direct tendency to dwarf and
spoil a field of young turnips; the
black fly, also, a natural enemy of the
turnip, is at this period very voracious,
and the crop is too often destroyed,
or rendered unprofitable from
one or the other of these causes.</p>

<p>With a view to remedy these evils,
I sowed my turnips two seasons ago,
very late in August. My neighbours
laughed at me, and said I would not
have a single mess. I had, however,
more and better turnips than any of
them. Encouraged by the success, I
sowed the last year, on the 25th of August,
a small piece of ground, eight
rods only, with turnips. They came
up well, and not a fly touched them.
When they had four or five leaves I
directed one of my men to weed and
thin them, so as to have them stand
eight or ten inches apart. The ground
afterwards was slightly stirred with a
garden hoe. The leaves grew rapidly,
covered the ground, and prevented
the further growth of weeds. On the
11th of November, I pulled the turnips,
trimmed and measured them,
and had on the eight rods of ground,
(the twentieth part of one acre only,)
forty-five bushels of as large and well
formed turnips as I ever saw. This
produce is at the rate of nine hundred
bushels to the acre. The soil is a
sandy loam, in good heart, but by no
means in high tilth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>I sowed two other small pieces of
ground, the one on the 1st, and the
other on the 8th of September. Neither
of these yielded like the one
sowed on the 25th August; but each
of them produced much larger and
better turnips, than I have seen, that
were sowed at the usual time.</p>

<p>I attribute my success altogether to
the late sowing; the heat is then less
intense, the rains more frequent, the
dews more copious, the fly harmless,
and the crop abundant.</p>

<p>I would earnestly recommend to
the farmers to set apart a small piece
of ground, and try the experiment of
late sowing, and I am confident they
will be amply compensated for making
the attempt, by a greater increase of
crops.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>On the use of Oxen and deep
ploughing in New England, by
Josiah Quincy, Esq.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, Nov. 2, 1817.<br />
</p>

<p><i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>

<p>In reply to your inquiries in your
last letter I answer:&mdash;Oxen are
used almost wholly for plough and
team work in this quarter of the country.
A single horse is usually kept
by our principal farmers, to go to mill,
and to church, and for the convenience
of the family. Occasionally he
precedes the oxen at plough, or on
the road. This is so universal as to
be almost without exception, among
mere farmers. They certainly answer
all purposes, except perhaps
speed; and in this, on a long journey,
they are considered as quite equal to
horses. But of this our farmers have
not many opportunities of comparison,
oxen are so universally used.
They are "worked" with yokes, and
"broken" when very young, pretty
much as men break horses.&mdash;Our farmers
are so satisfied with their utility
and economy that no argument would
induce them to change.</p>

<p>A very good yoke of oxen will cost
when well broke, and about five years
old, if well matched and of good size'
from 80 to 100 dollars. They continue
good, without accident, and with
good usage, until ten years old; then
they are usually fatted, and bring from
the butcher according to their size
and fatness from 100 to 120 dollars.</p>

<p>Whether oxen are not more susceptible
of <em>heat</em> than horses, I am ignorant.
My opinion is that they are.
A circumstance in your climate to be
ascertained in forming an opinion of
their comparative utility.</p>

<p>With respect to "deep ploughing,"
a considerable change is producing in
this state, in the opinion and practice
of farmers in this respect. Deep
ploughing begins to be more general
than formerly. I should state <em>five</em>
inches to be the most approved practice,
on turning up the sord for corn.
With respect to deepening it for other
crops, after the sord is broken, it depends
upon the nature of the crop
and the resources of the farmer, and
also the state of his soil. My own
rule is never to lay down land to grass
until it has been turned up to the
depth of <em>fourteen inches</em>. But my
practice is peculiar, as I carry a regular
succession of, 1st corn, 2d potatoes,
3d carrots, 4th grain, 5th grass,
over my whole farm; considering, as
I do, that <em>carrots</em> is of all farm products
the most profitable, and using
them as the test of the actual state of
the depth of tilth on my farm.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly when the depth of
ploughing pass the old tilth, and enters
upon the virgin soil, "manuring"
must be in proportion to the depth of
the virgin soil, which you turn, otherwise
you sacrifice present crop to future
crops;&mdash;a practice very discouraging
to any farmer.</p>

<p>I enclose you the newspaper account
of our last cattle show. A
more detailed statement will appear
in our Repository.</p>

<p>
Respectfully,</p>

<h2>SUGAR MAPLE.</h2>


<p>A letter writer in the Albany Statesman,
in giving an account of the New
York canal, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw for the first time the famous
ascersaccharinum, or sugar maple.
It grows spontaneously like all other
trees of the forest, and is a most beautiful
and stately tree.&mdash;It is said that
each tree will produce from three to
five pounds of sugar. An acre will
contain 30 trees, and a tree will be fit
for use in 15 years, and will probably
continue so for two centuries. An
orchard of ten acres would produce
annually two hogsheads and a half of
sugar, which can be made as good in
all respects as the produce of the
cane or the sweet beet. I speak from
ocular observation and from taste.
Mon. Le Ray, a very respectable and
sensible land holder in Jefferson county,
showed me at Washington Hall,
in New York, a sample of maple sugar,
which I have never seen excelled,
and which was raised on his estates
in that county; and I have been
told by Mr. George Parish, a most
accomplished and public spirited gentleman,
from St. Lawrence county,
that the inhabitants of that region not
only supply themselves with maple
sugar for domestic uses, but have a
surplus for market. A plantation of
maple trees of ten acres, beside being
highly ornamental and beneficial for
pasture&mdash;besides the use of the decayed
trees for fuel, and the acquisition
of excellent syrup and molasses,
and a sufficiency of sugar, for family
purposes, will yield a profit of $100
to the proprietor; and these operations
are carried on in the month of
March, continue but a short time, and
interfere with no other business. The
forests of the north and west, will supply
the other parts of the state with
the best of sugar and molasses through
the great canals."</p>

<h2>SURPRISING VIGOUR OF A WHALE.</h2>


<p>On the 25th of June, 1812, one of
the harpooners belonging to the Resolution,
of Whitby, under my command,
struck a whale by the edge of
a small floe of ice. Assistance being
promptly afforded, a second boat's
lines was attached to those of the <em>fast-boat</em>,
in a few minutes after the harpoon
was disgraced. The remainder
of the boats proceeded at some distance,
in the direction the fish seemed
to have taken. In about a quarter of
an hour the fast-boat, to my surprise,
again made a signal for lines. As
the ship was then within five minutes
sail, we instantly steered towards the
boat, with the view of affording assistance
by means of a spare boat we
still retained on board. Before we
reached the place, however, we observed
four oars displayed in signal
order, which by their number, indicated
a most urgent necessity for assistance.
Two or three men were at
the same time seen seated close by
the stern, which was considerably elevated,
for the purpose of keeping it
down; while the bow of the boat, by
the force of the line, was drawn down
to the level of the sea, and the harpooner,
by the friction of the line
round the bollard, was enveloped in
smoky obscurity. At length, when
the ship was scarcely 100 yards distant,
we perceived preparations for
quitting the boat. The sailor's pea-jackets
were cast upon the adjoining
ice, the oars were thrown down, the
crew leaped overboard, the bow of
the boat was buried in the water, the
stern rose perpendicularly and then
majestically disappeared. The harpooner
having caused the end of the
line to be fastened to the iron ring at
the boat's stern, was the means of its
loss;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and a <em>tongue</em> of the ice, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
which was a depth of several feet of
water, kept the boat, by the pressure
of the line against it, at such a considerable
distance, as prevented the
crew from leaping upon the floe.
Some of them were therefore put to
the necessity of swimming for their
preservation, but all of them succeeded
in scrambling upon the ice, and were
taken on board of the ship in a few
minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that it is an
uncommon circumstance for a fish to
require more than two boats' lines in
such a situation; none of our harpooners,
therefore, had any scruple
in leaving the fast-boat, never suspecting,
after it had received the assistance
of one boat with six lines or
upward, that it would need any more.</p>

<p>Several ships being about us, there
was a possibility that some person
might attack and make a prize of the
whale, when it had so far escaped us,
that we no longer retained any hold
of it; as such, we sat all the sail the
ship could safely sustain, and worked
through several narrow and intricate
channels in the ice, in the direction
I observed the fish had retreated. After
a little time it was descried by the
people in the boats, at a considerable
distance to the eastward; a general
chase immediately commenced, and
within the space of an hour three
harpoons were struck. We now imagined
the fish was secure, but our
expectations were premature. The
whale resolutely pushed beneath a
large floe that had been recently broken
to pieces by the swell, and soon
drew all the lines out of the second
fast-boat; the officer of which, not
being able to get any assistance, tied
the end of his line to a hammock of
ice, and broke it. Soon afterwards,
the other two boats, still <em>fast</em>, were
dragged against the broken floe, when
one of the harpoons drew out. The
lines of only one boat, therefore, remained
fast to the fish, and this with
six or eight lines out, was dragged
forward into the shattered floe with
astonishing force. Pieces of ice, each
of which was sufficiently large to have
answered the purpose of a mooring
for a ship were wheeled about by the
strength of the whale; and such was
the tension and elasticity of the line,
that whenever it slipped clear of any
mass of ice, after turning it round,
into the space between any two adjoining
pieces, the boat and its crew flew
forward through the crack, with the
velocity of an arrow, and never failed
to launch several feet upon the first
mass of ice that it encountered.</p>

<p>While we scoured the sea around
the broken floe with the ship, and
while the ice was attempted in vain
by the boats, the whale continued to
press forward in an easterly direction
towards the sea. At length, when 14
lines (about 1680 fathoms) were
drawn from the fourth fast-boat, a
slight entanglement of the line, broke
it at the stem. The fish then again
made its escape, taking along with it
a boat and 28 lines. The united
length of the lines was 6720 yards, or
upwards of 3<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> English miles; value,
with the boat, above 150<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p>The obstruction of the sunken boat,
to the progress of the fish, must have
been immense; and that of the lines
likewise considerable; the weight
of lines alone, being 25 hundred
weight.</p>

<p>So long as the fourth fast-boat,
through the medium of its lines, retained
its hold of the fish, we searched
the adjoining sea with the ship in
vain; but, in a short time after the
line was divided, we got sight of the
object of pursuit, at the distance of
near two miles to the eastward of the
ice and boats, in the open sea. One
boat only with lines, and two empty
boats, were reserved by the ship.
Having, however, fortunately fine
weather, and a fresh breeze of wind,
we immediately gave chase under all
sails; though, it must be confessed,
with the insignificant force by us, the
distance of the fish, and the rapidity
of its flight considered, we had but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
very small hopes of success. At
length, after pursuing it five or six
miles, being at least nine miles from
the place where it was struck, we
came up with it, and it seemed inclined
to rest after its extraordinary
exertions. The two dismantled or
empty boats having been furnished
with two lines each, (a very inadequate
supply,) they, together with the
one in a good state of equipment,
now made an attack upon the whale.
One of the harpooners made a blunder;
the fish saw the boat, took the
alarm, and again fled. I now supposed
it would be seen no more; nevertheless,
we chased nearly a mile
in the direction I imagined it had taken,
and placed the boats to the best
of my judgment, in the most advantageous
situations. In this case we
were extremely fortunate. The fish
rose near one of the boats, and was
immediately harpooned. In a few
minutes two more harpoons entered
its back, and lances were plied against
it with vigour and success. Exhausted
by its amazing exertions to
escape, it yielded itself at length to
its fate, received the piercing wounds
of the lances without resistance, and
finally died without a struggle. Thus
terminated with success, an attack
upon a whale, which exhibited the
most uncommon determination to escape
from its pursuers, seconded by
the most amazing strength of any individual
whose capture I ever witnessed.
After all, it may seem surprising,
that it was not a particularly
large individual; the largest lamina
of whalebone only measuring 9 feet
six inches, while those affording 12 feet
<em>bone</em> are not uncommon.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The quantity
of line withdrawn from the different
boats engaged in the capture, was
singularly great. It amounted, all
together, to 10,440 yards, or nearly
six English miles. Of these, 13 new
lines were lost, together with the
sunken boat; the harpoon connecting
them to the fish having dropt out
before the whale was killed.</p>

<p>"<i>Fishers thrown overboard, by
the jerking or sudden heeling of the
Boats, in consequence of blows from
Whales.</i>&mdash;On the third of June 1811,
a boat from the ship Resolution, commanded
at the time by myself, put off
in pursuit of a whale, and was rowed
upon its back. At the moment that
it was harpooned, it struck the side
of the boat a violent blow with its
tail, the shock of which threw the
boat-steerer to some distance into the
water. A repetition of the blow projected
the harpooner and line-manager
in a similar way, and completely
drenched the part of the crew remaining
in the boat, with the sprays.
One of the men regained the boat,
but as the fish immediately sunk, and
drew the boat away from the place,
his two companions in misfortune
were soon left far beyond the reach
of assistance. The harpooner though
a practised swimmer, felt himself
so brushed and enervated by a blow
he had received on the chest, that he
was totally incapacitated from giving
the least support to his fellow sufferer.
The ship being happily near, a boat
which had been lowered on the first
alarm, arrived to their succour, at the
moment when the line-manager, who
was unacquainted with the art of
swimming, was on the point of sinking,
to rise no more. Both the line-manager
and harpooner were preserved;
and the fish, after a few hours
close pursuit, was subdued.</p>

<p>A large whale harpooned from a
boat belonging to the same ship, became
the subject of a general chase
on the 23d of June, 1809. Being
myself in the first boat which approached
the fish, I struck my harpoon
at arm's length, by which we fortunately
evaded a blow that appeared to be
aimed at the boat. Another boat then
advanced, and another harpoon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
struck, but not with the same result;
for the stroke was immediately returned
by a tremendous blow from
the fishes tail. The boat was sunk
by the shock; and, at the same time,
whirled round with such velocity, that
the boat-steerer was precipitated into
the water, on the side next to the fish,
and was accidentally carried down to a
considerable depth by its tail. After
a minute or so, he arose to the surface
of the water and was taken up,
along with his companions, into my
boat. A similar attack was made on
the next boat which came up; but
the harpooner being warned of the
prior conduct of the fish, used such
precautions, that the blow, though
equal in strength, took effect only in
an inferior degree. The boat was
slightly stove. The activity and skill
of the lancers soon overcame this
designing whale, accomplished its
capture, and added its produce to the
cargo of the ship. Such intentional
mischief on the part of a whale, it
must be observed, is an occurrence
which is somewhat rare."</p>

<h3>WILD HORSES AND ASSES.</h3>


<p>There are thousands of horses
which are wild in the forests, and do
not belong to any one. I was enabled
to ascertain a fact, known to all
who have travelled in this country.
The horses live there in societies, generally
to the number of five or six
hundred, and even one thousand:
they occupy immense savannas, where
it is dangerous to disturb or try to
catch them. In the dry season they
are sometimes obliged to go two or
three leagues, and even more, to find
water. They set out in regular ranks
of four abreast, and thus form a procession
of an extent of a quarter of a
league. There are always five or six
scouts, who precede the troop by
about fifty paces. If they perceive a
man or jaguar (the American tiger,)
they neigh, and the troop stops: if
avoided, they continue their march;
but, if an attempt be made to pass by
their squadron, they leap on the imprudent
traveller, and crush him under
their feet. The best way is always
to avoid them, and let them continue
their route: they have also a
chief, who marches between the
scouts and the squadron, and five or
six other horses march on each side
of the band,&mdash;a kind of adjutants,
whose duty consists in hindering any
individual from quitting the ranks.
If any one attempts to straggle either
from hunger or fatigue, he is bitten
till he resumes his place, and the culprit
obeys with his head hanging
down. Three or four chiefs march
as the rear guard, at five or six paces
from the troop. I had often heard,
at Trinidad, of this discipline among
the wild horses, and confess that I
could scarcely believe it, but what I
have just stated is a fact which I witnessed
twice on the banks of the
Guaripiche, where I encamped five
days, for the express purpose of seeing
those organized troops pass. I
have met, on the shores of the Orinoco,
herds of fifty to a hundred wild
oxen: a chief always marched at the
head, and another at the rear.</p>

<p>The people of the country have
assured me, that the wild asses, when
they travel, observe the same discipline
as the horses; but the mules,
though they also live in troops, are
continually fighting with each other,
and it has not been observed that they
have any chief. They however unite,
at the appearance of a common enemy,
and display still more trick and
address than the horses, in avoiding
the snares which are laid for catching
them, and also for escaping when
taken.</p>

<h2>PREMIUMS FOR WORKMANSHIP.</h2>


<p><i>Boston, July 6.</i>&mdash;Agreeably to custom,

town, for the best specimen of an entire
Chaise Harness, silver plated, and
entirely of American workmanship.
The second premium of six dollars,
was also awarded to these gentlemen.</p>

<p>That a Medal, of the value of
twelve dollars, was awarded to Mr.
Thomas Burdle, of Boston, for the
best made six-pannelled door; and
that the premium of six dollars was
awarded to Henry Chulbrick, for the
next best.</p>

<p>That a Medal, of the value of
twelve dollars, was awarded to Mr.
Addison Bacon, Hanover-street, for
the best made pair of Chaise Wheels;
and that a premium of six dollars was
awarded to Mr. Oliver Ames, of
Norton, for the next best.</p>

<p>That a Medal, of the value of
eight dollars, was awarded to Wm.
Jordan, (an apprentice of Mr. Daniel
Adams) for the best made Ship
Block, with two sheeves; and that
the premium of four dollars was
awarded to John B. Ingolls, (an apprentice
of Messrs. Dupee and Badger)

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><i>From Johnson's Influence of Civil
Life, Sedentary Habits and Intellectual
Refinements, or Human
Health and Happiness, &amp;c.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><i>Parallel of enjoyment and suffering
in drink.</i>&mdash;The water drinker glides
tranquilly through life, without much
exhileration or depression, and escapes
many diseases to which he
would otherwise be subject. The
wine drinker experiences short, but
vivid periods of rapture, and long intervals
of gloom; he is also more
subject to disease. The balance of
enjoyment, then, turns decidedly in
favour of the water drinker, leaving
out his temporal <em>prosperity</em> and future
anticipations; and the nearer we
keep to his regimen, the happier we
shall be. Here, however, as is in all
other things, there is a certain latitude
within the range of health and
happiness which the wise man and
the philosopher will occasionaly travel
round, but not exceed.&mdash;The <em>native
fountain</em> is in the centre, and
from it our eccentric divergences
should be narrowly watched and carefully
limited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Density, weight, &amp;c. of the earth.</i>&mdash;From
the experiment of Maskelyne,
and the calculations of Hutton,
Cavendish, Laplace, &amp;c. it appears,
that considering the specific gravity
of water as unity, the mean density of
the earth would be according to Hutton,
4.95, or according to Cavendish,
5.48. The mean most commonly
adopted is 5.4. Taking this as our
ground work, we may now proceed to
that most singular question of <em>weighing</em>
the earth.</p>

<p>Assuming 7920 miles as the mean
diameter of the earth, the number of
cubic miles will be 239,979,311,961.
Now each cubic mile contains
147,197,952,000 cubic feet;
also every cubic foot of water weighs
1000 avoirdupoise ounces.</p>

<p>Hence a cubic mile of water will
weigh 4,107,085,714 tons, and consequently
a globe of water of equal dimensions
with our earth would weigh
985,594,985,000,000,000,000 tons,
and that multiplied by the calculated
density 5.4, gives
5,322,212,919,540,000,000,000 tons
for the weight of our earth.</p>

<p><i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;The Poughkeepsie Herald
states, that Mr. Joseph Waddle, of
the town of Washington, Dutchess
county, has sold, at the New York
market, during the last six weeks, the
produce of ten apple trees for the almost
incredible sum of three hundred
and sixty dollars&mdash;they were of a species
called Summer Russets; the
quantity fifty barrels. These apples
grew on ten trees, which altogether
occupy less than one quarter of an
acre of ground. When the apples
were first gathered last fall they filled
fifty-three barrels, and on being picked
over this spring, preparatory to
sending them to market, they were
reduced to fifty barrels.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural Anecdote.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Furius
Cresinus, as mentioned by Pliny, the
Roman historian, was originally a slave.
Having been made a freedman, he purchased
a small spot of ground, from
which he obtained, through his unwearied
industry, much finer crops
than many of the neighbours, who had
larger farms. This excited general
envy, which his enemies carried to such
a length as to accuse him of employing
magic charms to render his own
grounds fertile and to impoverish
heirs. The <i>Edile</i> caused him to be
summoned to appear and answer the
charge before the people of Rome.
Crecinus obeyed the mandate, accompanied
by his daughter, a fresh and
healthy coloured girl&mdash;charms which
appeared to greater advantage from
the symplicity of her dress. The accused
also brought with him the tools
and instruments of his profession.
They were in excellent condition. His
mattocks were remarkably heavy, his
plough was of an enormous size, and
his cattle were all sound and fat.
"Behold!" said this truly dignified
and indignant farmer, "behold my
whole magical equipage! behold the
charms which I have recourse to!
There are others, indeed, which I am
not capable of producing before you;
I mean the sweat of my brow, and incessant
toils both by day and night."
This native eloquence decided the
matter; he was honourably acquitted
by the unanimous voice of a numerous
and applauding assembly.</p>

<p>A mechanic in the North has invented a
machine for seminaries, which, by means
of steam, not only warms the room, but
<em>flogs all the boys</em> "on a graduated scale,"
according to their offences.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Line.</i>&mdash;This noted Irish physician,
who died of the small pox at the
age of 85, built a house in a peculiar
manner, so as to have the full benefit
of the circulation of the air. Every
window had another opposite to it,
none of which he ever suffered to be
shut or glazed. The room in which
he slept had four open windows, two
on each side of his bed. It was remarked
that, for fifty years together
nobody died in his house. He carried
this doctrine to such an excess, as to
contend that no house could be wholesome,
where a dog could not get in under
the door and a bird at the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Upon his death, his son had all the
windows glazed; soon after which, several
persons were <em>buried out of the
house</em>.</p>

<p>The late king of England concurred
a little in this practice of Dr. Line.
In the rooms where he and his family
resided, he never suffered a carpet to
be laid; and in the chimney places
allowed but a very scanty portion of
fire&mdash;barely enough to aid the circulation
of the air and prevent damps.</p>

<p><i>Internal Improvements.</i>&mdash;In consequence
of the facilities afforded by
that part of the great canal which is
completed, Plaster of Paris, or Gypsum,
which abounds in the western
parts of New York, is now selling at
Utica at from $1.50 to $2.00 per ton,
and it is supposed that any part of that
great tract of country lying on the
Hudson, may be supplied with it at
from 4 to 5 dollars! Onondaga salt
will be sold at Albany at from 31 to
37 cents per bushel; and a bushel of
wheat, which formerly cost 44 cents
to transport it to that city, will be
brought there from the interiour, for
the small sum of 5 cents. In truth,
this canal when finished, will, seemingly,
bring the most remote places,
even the most distant points of the
great lakes, into the neighbourhood
of the port of New York.</p>

<p><i>The Coronation of George IV.</i>
which is to take place August, 1st, is
to be conducted on the most economical
scale, and is not to cost more
than about $450.000!! The price of
a coronation dress for a peer and
peeress is estimated at about $3.600.</p>

<p><i>Marriage Promise.</i>&mdash;In Somerset
county, New Jersey, a young lady
lately received the sum of 1250 dollars
damages, for a breach of promise
of marriage.</p>

<p><i>Mobile</i> is becoming a place of great
importance; about 10,000 bales of
cotton have been shipped from this
port in the present year, and 6,000
remained on hand. This shews an
increase of 10,000 bales since last
year; and it is calculated that at least
10,000 more will be shipped next
year than in the present.</p>

<p><i>The number of letters</i> delivered
daily by the post in Paris is, on an
average, 32,000; of journals, 18,000.
In London, the average of letters is
133,000, and journals 26,000.</p>

<p><i>Cincinnati, June 15.</i>&mdash;On Saturday
last, in digging the well of Mr.
Wright, near Harrison, in this county,
near a mile from White-Water,
and about 14 feet from the surface, in
a bed of rounded limestone pebbles,
a living frog was dug up, which in a
short time, hopped away as nimbly as
if he had been but a year old. There
are trees contiguous, and in lower
ground, more than 500 years old,
which have evidently taken the places
of others of equal growth; so that
this frog had probably lain buried for
1000 years.</p>

<p><i>Mean temperature of the Earth.</i>&mdash;According
to Laplace, any actual diminution
of the mean temperature of
the earth would be detected by a diminution
of the length of the day.&mdash;It
appears by computation, that one
degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer
would make an alteration of nearly
one second in the length of a day, and
four or five minutes in that of a year.</p>

<p><i>Heat.</i>&mdash;The effect of heat in expanding
iron is strongly shown by a
gate of that material in this town.&mdash;In
the cool of the morning it shuts
with a considerable spare space, (in
the winter perhaps an 8th of an inch)
in the middle of a hot day the joints
touch, and some force is necessary to
close it. The gate is about 3<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> feet
wide.</p>

<h2>AGRICULTURAL MEMORANDA.</h2>


<p><i>To preserve Cattle from Disease in
the Winter.</i>&mdash;When cattle are kept
out in the winter, it is recommended
as a useful practice to rub some tar
at the root of the horn, which prevents
the wet from getting between the root
and the skin; and it is said, contributes
so preserve the health of the animal,
and to keep it free from various diseases
to which it may otherwise be
liable.</p>

<p><i>Rules for Milking Cows.</i>&mdash;Cows
should be milked three times a day,
if fully fed, throughout the summer,
and <em>great caution should be exercised
by the persons employed, to draw the
milk from them completely</em>, not only
to encrease the quantity of produce,
but to preserve its quality. Any portion
which may be left in the udder,
seems gradually to be absorbed into
the system, and no more is formed
than enough to supply what is taken
away; and by the continuance of the
same mode, a yet further dimunition
of the secretion takes place, until at
length scarcely any is produced. This
last mode of milking is always practised
when it is intended that a cow
should be rendered dry.</p>

<p><i>Additional quantity of Milk to be
gained by keeping Milch Cows in the
house.</i>&mdash;In the management of cows,
a warm stable is highly necessary;
and currying them like horses, not
only affords them pleasure, but makes
them give their milk more freely.
They ought always to be kept clean,
laid dry, and have plenty of good
sweet water to drink. Cows treated
in this manner, have given ten gallons
of milk at a time, when within ten
days of calving.</p>

<p><i>To prevent Cows from contracting
bad habits while milking.</i>&mdash;Cows
should be always treated with great
gentleness, and soothed by mild usage,
especially when young and ticklish,
or when the paps are tender, in which
case the udder ought to be fomented
with warm water before milking, and
touched with the greatest gentleness,
otherwise the cow will be in danger
of contracting bad habits, becoming
stubborn and unruly, and retaining
her milk ever after. A cow never
lets down her milk pleasantly to the
person she dreads or dislikes. The
udder and paps, should always be
washed with clean water before milking;
but care should be taken that
none of that water be admitted into
the milking pail.</p>

<p>Sir George M'Kenzie has discovered
that oil rubbed upon the stems and
branches of fruit trees destroys insects,
and increases the fruit buds. Mr.
John Linning, has added to the discovery,
by using it successfully upon
the stems of carnations, to guard them
against the depredations of the earwig.
The coarsest oil will suit, and
only a small quantity is required.</p>

<p><i>To prevent smut in wheat.</i>&mdash;Take
four quarts of good lye, or a sufficient
quantity to wet your seed, and add to
it a bushel of wheat, stirring till the
whole is alike wet, then sow it immediately,
as the strong lye will injure
the seed if delayed. The lye may be
as strong as you can bare to sow without
injury to the hand. A little tallow
applied to the hand will prevent
injury from the lye. I have continued
this practice 12 years out of 20;
and have never known it to fail of success.
I have frequently made use of
smutty wheat for seed, and found my
crops perfectly free from smut. Much
depends on having the lye sufficiently
strong to take off the fuz on wheat.</p>

<p><i>For preserving Eggs.</i>&mdash;In March,
put about half a pound of quick lime
in a stone or earthen pot, and add a
gallon of cold water;&mdash;next day fill
the pot with new eggs, tie a paper
over it and put the pot in a cool place.
The eggs will be found perfectly good
after being kept a year.</p>

<p>It is quite necessary to keep lime
in the walks of your hens, as it causes
their laying eggs throughout the winter.</p>

<h3>TO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</h3>


<p>The following little poem was written by
<span class="smcap">John Byron</span>, a minor English poet, who died
at Manchester, in the year 1763, aged 72. In
his 23d year, he wrote the beautiful pastoral
of Colin and Phebe, on which his poetick reputation
is principally founded. It appeared
in the eighth volume of the Spectator; and
many of your readers will remember, what
has been so generally known and admired.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Phebe went with me wherever I went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand sweet pleasures I felt in my breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure never fond shepherd like Colin was blest! &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The subjoined extract, it is believed, is not
so familiar; and for that reason, as you must
doubtless wish to exclude from your poetick
corner whatever is trite and common-place,
whether <em>professedly</em> original, or selected from
old or distant writers, it is hoped, though a
small matter, it will not prove altogether unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Six cubic yards contain 162 cubic feet,
or three cart loads for a pair of oxen. A
cart body, 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2
feet high, <em>in the clear</em>, contains 56 cubic
feet; and three times 56 are 168.&mdash;I doubt
the necessity of manure being "in a rotten
state," seeing it is to be so deeply buried,
for this or any other root crop intended
for the food of domestic animals; especially
for Mangel Wurtzel, which to obtain
a full crop, should be sown very early,
as soon as the ground is dry enough to be
ploughed. The powerful fermentation of
fresh dung might impart to the soil a salutary
warmth in the cool spring season&mdash;At
least it may be worth while to try it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> These narrow ridges, as formed by
the plough, are sharp; by passing a light
roller over them, they are flattened to a
breadth of 8 or 9 inches. The light roller,
drawn by a horse, that walks in the
furrow between them, flattens two ridges
at a time. Thus rolled, the manure will
be covered 8 or 9 inches deep.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> A dibble is a simple tool, which may
be of different sizes and forms, according
to the uses it is intended to serve. If for
setting (in transplanting) cabbages or other
like plants, it may be a round stick about
an inch and a quarter in diameter, shaved
down at one end (in a slope of 8 or 10
inches long) to a blunt point. An old
spade or shovel handle is well adapted to
the purpose. If much used, the slope may
be advantageously covered smoothly with
iron. But for putting in <em>seeds</em>, the dibble
may be in the form of the letter T. To
make one, take a piece of wood about 3
feet 4 inches long, and about an inch and
a quarter square. In one of the sides bore
holes in a line, and insert teeth at the proposed
distance of the plants in the row:
if for Mangel Wurtzel, at 10, 11 or 12
inches apart; and let the teeth be as long
(projecting from the head place) as the
proposed depth at which the seeds are to
be sown. On the opposite side of the
head-piece, bore a hole in the middle,
large enough to receive a handle of convenient
length. On the top of the handle
fix a cross-piece 5 or 6 inches long, to be
grasped by the hand in using the tool.&mdash;With
it, as many holes for seeds will be
made, at every movement, as there are
teeth in the head. The handle may require
bracing, in like manner as a rake
handle and its head is braced by means
of bows.
</p>
<p>
It now occurs to me, that perhaps the
light roller used in levelling the tops of
the ridges may be set with teeth, and thus
perform the additional office of making
holes for the seed; and with vastly greater
expedition than by dibbling. A light
roller, long enough to flatten two ridges
at once, of 13 inches in diameter, and furnished
with two sets of four teeth each
to pass along the middle of two adjoining
ridges&mdash;and the four teeth of each set being
inserted at equal distances in a circle
of the roller,&mdash;the holes for the seed
would be made at the desired distance of
near one foot from each other. The teeth
should be so shaped as to leave the holes
made by them fairly open. For this purpose
they may be an inch and a half wide
and three quarters of an inch thick, where
their shoulders are fayed to the roller,
and taper thence to a rounded thick edge
at their extremities. The same teeth, if
not too long, may serve to regulate and expedite
the sowing of the Ruta Baga seed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It is very important to have seeds of all
kinds sown as soon as possible after the
ground is ploughed and prepared to receive
them, and before the moisture of the
fresh-stirred earth is dissipated by the sun
and drying winds; otherwise some may
never vegetate, or not till after a fall of
rain; and so precious time may be lost,
and an uneven crop be produced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The time of taking up the Mangel
Wurtzel must be regulated by the climate.
There is sometimes a frost in the latter
part of October, in this county, severe
enough to injure this root, exposed, as the
greater part of it is above ground. Light
frosts, however, will do it no harm, while
the roots remain in the ground, and in a
degree sheltered by their leaves.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This great produce cannot fail to astonish
many persons living in this country.
But let them recollect, that the upper layer
of the soil, from which the crops are produced,
is never changed here; that this
layer, having been so often used, must have
lost part of its ancient fertility; that dung
is not spread in abundance with us as in
Flanders; and that it is possible the species
of potatoes grown here have degenerated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> It is well known, that vegetables will
grow in pure sand, by watering them, and
that it is not till they blossom, or rather
till they produce seed, that they perish.
It is mentioned by Bracconnot, in the <cite>Annales
de Chimie</cite>, for February and March,
1808, that he sowed the seeds of various
plants in pure river sand, in litharge, in flour
of sulphur, and even among metal, or common
leaden shot; and in every instance he
employed only <em>distilled water</em> for their nourishment.
The plants throve, and passed
through all the usual gradations of growth
to perfect maturity. The author then proceeded
to gather the entire produce, the
roots, stems, leaves, pods, &amp;c. These were accurately
weighed, dried, and again weighed;
then submitted to the ordinary means used
in a careful analysis, when he obtained from
these vegetables, all the materials peculiar
to each individual species, precisely as if it
had been cultivated in a natural soil. "Oxygen
and hydrogen, (says this writer) with
the assistance of solar light, appear to be
the only elementary substances employed
in the constitution of the whole universe:
and Nature in her simple progress, works
the most infinitely diversified effects by the
slightest modification in the means she employs."</p></div>

sacrifice of a boat is termed, is a
scheme not unfrequently practised by the
fisher when in want of line. By submitting
